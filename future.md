_Smartphones are a sign of the speed of innovation that our homes may soon face. These rapid lifecyles bring risks, such as security vulnerabilities and broken devices. There's an urgency to address these issues now, and to ensure throughout that the home remains a place that puts humans first._  

## The speed of change

In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone and shortly thereafter in 2008, Google released its first Android device. At the time of writing, those milestones are just shy of a decade ago. 

These touchscreen phones represent a threshold in the evolution and adoption of the smartphone. In the years prior, there had been a range of exploratory devices, such as Nokia's first clamshell phone and PDAs running PalmOS that one could interact with using a stylus.

Since the advent of the iPhone and Android, we've seen entire industries and social practices boom. App stores, smartphone accessories, the rise of mobile photography, messaging, payment and more.

If anything, the last decade shows us how quickly new technologies can spread and become mundane in their ubiquity. We anticipate a similar trajectory for the connected home. 

While today's connected objects can be clunky and exploratory, there will be some iconic releases or "must have" devices that change how people see this space: The iPhone moment of the connected home.

After this threshold, there will be electronics and connectivity in many of our everyday objects. At this stage, the speed of change of our built environment will start to resemble that of our computing environment. The lifecycle of things in our homes will be shortened dramatically. 

Software will need to be patched, devices will be turned incompatible and obsolete. Entire services will rise and fall in months. 

Our homes will move at the speed of our smartphones -or faster. 

## The risks

With this speed of innovation comes volatility and unpredictability. As a side effect we will likely see an increase in waste and exploitation. There will be vulnerabilities and breaches. If history can teach us anything, it is to expect these patterns - we have seen them in many waves of technological advances before. 

With that knowledge, we can approach the connected home with some understanding of what is to come. 

For example, let's look at security. As our built environment begins to change at the speed of software, our homes may experience new kinds of security vulnerabilities. 

A smart lock system is installed in your front door. The company who makes the locks goes bankrupt: There is no longer a support service to maintain your locks. At some point, your locks might get jammed, or hacked, or incompatible with your smartphone's latest update. You can no longer patch security bugs in your smart lock. And the lock on your front door is no longer in your control.    

These scenarios abound. As we make and use connected objects, we must consider how security can gracefully accompany the objects throughout their lifecycle - from installment to use and maintenance, to upgrading, to uninstalling and dismantling.  


## Humans first

There's an urgency to figure out these issues, and huge opportunity to innovate. In order to succeed, we need updated vocabularies, literacies, and ways to negotiate and resolve conflicts around the often thorny issues of data and sharing preferences.
 
Above all else, a home is a home. And as such, we need to approach all these issues not purely through a technological or design method but by putting humans first.

## Vectors

As of today, we're working under the assumption that it will take another 10 years or so for most homes to cross some kind of "connectedness threshold" - with the notable exception (and we're painting in broad strokes here) of Asia's mega cities, where often large-scale network infrastructure is dropped right into new buildings to a much higher degree than in many Western cities, where retro-fitting is a bigger thing.

The way we will get used to the technologies, and where we will thus also develop the social norms around these kind of new interactions, is most likely through **the vectors of retail spaces, office buildings, and hotels**: Interstitial, transactional contexts where we engage much more openly with infrastructure due to the temporary nature of the interaction. Places where we are more accepting of privacy-diminishing interactions if they either come with a net gain or if they seem, frankly, simply unavoidable. Then, over time, these things will find their ways into our homes.

Five or ten years from now the moment we enter a home might require some decisions from us: It might be a transition into a connected space, and it might not be obvious how connected it is, and in which ways. Yet, these are essential things to know to make an informed decision.

Consider some of the following scenes. (Please note that many of examples used here might be framed rather more extreme than we might encounter in real life, in order to provoke some thoughts and jog our creativity.)

- The moment we approach the door we might be scanned, visually via camera, or maybe for data transmissions: Do we get a say in this? Or will it be as commonplace as a ringer with a CCTV camera as we've been using them for years?
- Once you step inside, will the smart home welcome us, or examine us more intrusively through a set of scans, say maybe by probing our vital signs, our digital ID or our data-transmitting devices? Will it be firewalled against virus-infections our phones might have that we are not even aware of?
- Will a voice personally greet us inside, or will the home not be aware of who we are? Will be be able to have the home greet us in a way we personally prefer, even if it's not our own home but a friend's?

These are just some simple examples of a first encounter with a connected space: How will it be communicated what will happen? How can the house manage expectations? And can we opt out or is this a click-OK-end-the-end-of-the-EULA type situation? 

Now zoom in, from this isometric outside view that considers the home as one unit, viewed from some distance. We're now in a friend's living room: How does the room convey to us what's going on, how do we convey to the room what we expect of it? 

Zoom in even further and consider individual things: The vase on the table, the ebook on the sofa table, the lamp in the shelf, the digital picture frame on the wall. Which of these things are hooked up to a network? Which ones sense and collect data, which ones create or send data? Which ones are happy to just do their thing passively (maybe the vase measures carbon monoxide levels), which ones expect our interactions (maybe the picture frame offers us to share some of our own preferred images on it)? 

How would any of these things be communicated? As things stand today, we usually invite smart objects into our lives only after a certain amount of deliberation, simply because they are the exception rather than the rule: If we buy a Nest thermostat, we more or less know what we are doing. Increasingly, as connectivity retreats more into the background, the fabric of our lives, we will see more subtle ways of interactions. It is very likely that we will not recognize any particular connected device simply because there will be so many more; they will just be around, maybe with little or no consideration.

An overt approach would be labeling: A set of icons that indicate what is collecting data, what is transmitting data, what is analyzing data. What reacts, what just does its thing without requiring our oversights. Which spaces in the apartment are "dead zones" of perfect privacy.

_The blunt approach of labeling: A set of icons that indicate what is collecting data, what is transmitting data, what is analyzing data. "Does this thing listen or watch? Does it share data to the cloud?" Some possible connected device engagement icons.[^2]_

Labeling does not, of course, scale in the least. It is inelegant, entirely undesirable and takes too much active consideration to be practical in day to day life. It is not, in other words, legible enough to serve its purpose: Just like a legal contract offers all relevant information but isn't really, truly "human-readable", this wouldn't quite do the trick.

Maybe a direct machine-to-machine approach might be more powerful: We set our personal preferences (pur own ground rules) that are saved in a device we always have on ourselves (phones, fitness tracker...) and the home transmits its own ground rules. Algorithmically, both negotiate what's going to happen based on ground rules that we have established as social norms. This is certainly interesting. But it also is a highly technical solution, which brings its own set of complications.

If, for example, a person chooses not to have or use the device or app that transmits their personal ID and preferences, the system might not recognize them. The person might, for all practical purposes, not exist as far as the house is concerned, much like the Nest thermostat doesn't necessarily play well with multi-person households in which not everyone uses the Nest app.

## We need to develop a vocabulary for these kind of interactions

Currently, these are all just questions: A kind of stream of consciousness that sounds banal at best and creepy at worst. None of these scenarios sound desirable. Before we can focus on the opportunities that a connected home can offer - for ways a smart home can help us be more human, more ourselves - we might need to evolve a vocabulary for all the many types of interactions we will be increasingly facing. Otherwise our questions and answers are bound not to fit the challenges we want to consider.

To understand and communicate the ground rules for the connected home, we need to find the words to describe them.

## Privacy as opportunity

We see privacy as an opportunity both in terms of a design constraint and as a way for companies to positively differentiate themselves from their competition.

By going way beyond the EU's General Data Protection Regulation[^3] players in the connected home market can proactively build in stronger privacy protections and earn consumers' trust.


## Our homes must respect us

On the web, our behavior is constantly tracked by advertising companies and other, even less savory organizations. This happens almost entirely without our consent, frequently under dubious ethical and legal practices, largely without recourse. 

On the web, the only means of protection are personal education in the matter (to at least understand what's going on) as well as technical measures, like ad & tracking blockers, as well as browser features/plug-ins like Do Not Track. **Between them, these measures provide a certain measure of privacy, but neither is this sufficient nor is it sufficiently easy.** We got to this point because for too long, the open nature of the web allowed bad players to foster a culture of tracking without recourse or penalties. 

**For the context of the connected home, we must not commit these same mistakes. We need to establish standards, regulatory frameworks and a culture that respects the ethical dimensions of the safe place that is the home.**

As for adaption of connectivity inside our homes, we have no doubt that it will happen. Not out of some techno-deterministic world view, but because we learned over the last couple of decades that connectivity & data add value to all parts of our lives if done right. 

We assume that the ways this will happen might need some getting used to, and that it will happen not along the lines of well-established metaphors like automation or personalization: These will likely seem as quirky and ridiculous in hindsight as the futuristic computerized kitchen did in the 1950s (both in terms of gender roles and the technological aspects).

Rather, the smartness will manifest in ways both banal and novel, and the vector will (hopefully, and most likely) be smarts that are "on the user", in whichever way. If we had to guess, we'd say they will be probably fairly low-tech, bottom up interventions that just make things a little easier, more interesting, more useful: **A connected home should help us be more human, more ourselves.**

Much more tricky is how we will deal with our preferences regarding various levels of scanning, sharing data, and (by extension) surveillance.

### Automation is a natural first step

The connected home products we see on the market today (or judging by conversations with many manufacturers and designers working in the field, on the way to market) focus to a large degree on home automation. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a natural first step. It's (comparatively) simple and offers a clear value (if done right), so it's (again, comparatively) low-hanging fruit.

Maybe more importantly, automation does not require a lot of explanation: _I used to regulate my heater by hand, now it self-regulates._ Simple to understand, no explanation needed.

Inarguably, there's a lot to be gained for users from home automation. Nobody would argue with the convenience and time savings of a laundry machine, a dishwasher or a vacuum cleaner. 

The same will hold true for many connected home appliances. The true automation magic might, however, not happen at the device level. Everyone who ever had to install one smartphone app per connected home device - thermostat, lightbulb, smart lock - will agree, the trick might turn out to be smart integration at the software layer: One app to rule them all.[^4]

San Francisco-based startup [Thington](http://thington.com/) offers a simple concierge-like interface that aims to bring all smart home devices into one app based on their APIs. It's an easy-to-use approach with intelligent, well-designed interactions. Other approaches that are even more explicitly conversational include the smart home hubs Amazon Echo and Google Home, both of which bring voice control into the home (and fold their respective mother companies' services right in).
