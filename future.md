# Future

## WRITTEN M
## PROOFED?

_Smartphones are a sign of the speed of change that our homes may soon face. These rapid lifecyles bring risks, such as security vulnerabilities and broken devices. There's an urgency to address these issues now, and to ensure throughout that the home remains a place that puts humans first._  

## The speed of change

In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone. Shortly thereafter in 2008, Google released its first Android device. At the time of writing, those milestones are just shy of a decade ago. 

These touchscreen smartphones represent a threshold in the evolution and spread of the phone. In the years prior, there had been a range of exploratory devices, such as Nokia's first clamshell phone and PDAs running PalmOS that one could interact with using a stylus.

Since the advent of the iPhone and Android, we've seen entire industries and social practices boom. App stores, accessories, the rise of mobile photography, messaging, payment and more.

If anything, the last decade shows us how quickly new technologies can be picked up,, shake things up and then become mundane in their ubiquity. We anticipate a similar trajectory for the connected home. 

While today's connected objects are often clunky and exploratory, there will be some iconic releases or "must have" developments that change how people see this space. 

After this threshold, there will be electronics and connectivity in many more of our everyday objects. Because these objects will be controlled by software, the speed of change of our built environment will start to resemble that of our other computing environments. The lifecycle of things in our homes will be shortened.  

Firmware will need to be patched. Devices will be incompatible and obsolete. Entire services will rise and fall in months. 

The era of the "disrupted home" is coming. 

## The risks

With this speed of innovation comes volatility and unpredictability. It will generate lots of waste and exploitation. There will be vulnerabilities and breaches. These patterns are pretty much inevitable--predicted by many waves of technological advances before them. 

With that knowledge, we can approach the connected home with some understanding of what is to come. 

For example, let's look at security. As our built environment begins to change at the speed of software, our homes may experience new kinds of security vulnerabilities. 

A smart lock system is installed in your front door. The company who makes the locks goes broke. There is no longer a support service to maintain your locks. At some point, your lock gets jammed, or hacked or incompatible with your smartphone's latest update. You can no longer patch security bugs in your smart lock. Some of your personal information is compromised. And the lock on your front door is no longer in your control.    

These scenarios abound.[^2] As we make and use connected objects, we must take into account the lifecycles of these products and servces. How something ends is just as important as how it begins.[^3] Considerations such as security must be addressed not only at the moment of purpose, but in anticipation for how the object will be used for years to come. 

From installment, to use and maintenance, to upgrading, to uninstalling and dismantling, technology must be in service to humans and put our concerns and needs first.   

## The home is for humans

There's an urgency to figure out these issues. A lot is at stake, from our personal data, to safety and the health of our relationships and interactions at home. 

As with the rise of smartphones, like many waves of technological change before it, with the rise of the connected home we will need updated vocabularies, literacies, ways to negotiate and resolve conflicts.

We will continue to explore concepts and scenarios that bring these risks and opportunities to life. And throughout, we will be guided by the understanding that above all else, no matter what technology can, the home is for the people living in it.   

## What will a connected home look like?

There aren't many connected homes today. Similar to smartphone proliferation, it might take a decade for products to go from invention to widespread adoption. 

Exceptions may be in some cities, such as in South Korea, where large-scale network infrastructure is being installed directly into the new buildings. In other places, retro-fitting will be a more common path to connectedness, and that will likely move at a slower pace. 

For another glimpse of what the connected home may be like, we can examine the trajectories of other connected environments, such as **retail spaces, office buildings, and hotels.**  

These spaces tend to be interstitial, transactional contexts. Due to the generally temporary nature of our interactions in those spaces, we tend to use them with less emotional investment and critical thinking than our homes. For example, in a high street store, we may be more accepting of privacy-diminishing interactions[^4] if they come with financial gain or if they seem, frankly, unavoidable.

Our retail environments, as well as offices and transportation spaces, should communicate how connected they are and in which ways. We should be able to make an informed decision whether to enter and what information we consent to giving.

Increasingly, we will be faced with these decisions upon entering a home.  

## Privacy as opportunity

Already our behavior in many spaces is being tracked. As we move through the city, into stores and offices, in transit and on our devices, many systems are recording what we look at, what we click on and what we do. 

On the web, advertising companies are particularly aggressive in how they track us. Through consumer education and browser tools like ad blockers and Do Not Track, we can mitigate these tracking measures a bit. However, it is basically an arms race in online advertising, where we as users get the short end of the stick: our privacy is increasingly eroded and our web experiences slowed down as ad companies try to ensure we are humans and serve us tailored ads.[^6] 

**In our homes, we should not have to fight the same battles against trackers.** 

For anyone making connected products today, there is a huge opportunity to build in better privacy. Companies can innovate by offering high default settings, better controls over how personal data is collected and shared, as well as assurances when data is deleted. These will be features that people increasingly seek out, as the prevailing practices of tracking in our online lives and in public spaces encroaches into our home. 

The future is one that promises augmentation. But the only kind of connection and augmentation we want is one that we can fully read, control and participate in, and then, whenever we want, turn off.
