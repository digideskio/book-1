_Smartphones are a sign of the speed of change that our homes may soon face. These rapid lifecyles bring risks, such as security vulnerabilities and broken devices. There's an urgency to address these issues now, and to ensure throughout that the home remains a place that puts humans first._  

## The speed of change

In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone. Shortly thereafter in 2008, Google released its first Android device. At the time of writing, those milestones are just shy of a decade ago. 

These touchscreen smartphones represent a threshold in the evolution and spread of the phone. In the years prior, there had been a range of exploratory devices, such as Nokia's first clamshell phone and PDAs running PalmOS that one could interact with using a stylus.

Since the advent of the iPhone and Android, we've seen entire industries and social practices boom. App stores, accessories, the rise of mobile photography, messaging, payment and more.

If anything, the last decade shows us how quickly new technologies can spread and become mundane in their ubiquity. We anticipate a similar trajectory for the connected home. 

While today's connected objects can be clunky and exploratory, there will be some iconic releases or "must have" devices that change how people see this space: The iPhone moment of the connected home.

After this threshold, there will be electronics and connectivity in many of our everyday objects. At this stage, the speed of change of our built environment will start to resemble that of our computing environment. The lifecycle of things in our homes will be shortened dramatically. 

Software will need to be patched, devices will be turned incompatible and obsolete. Entire services will rise and fall in months. 

Our homes will move at the speed of our smartphones -or faster.

If anything, the last decade shows us how quickly new technologies can be picked up,, shake things up and then become mundane in their ubiquity. We anticipate a similar trajectory for the connected home. 

While today's connected objects are often clunky and exploratory, there will be some iconic releases or "must have" developments that change how people see this space. 

After this threshold, there will be electronics and connectivity in many more of our everyday objects. Because these objects will be controlled by software, the speed of change of our built environment will start to resemble that of our other computing environments. The lifecycle of things in our homes will be shortened.  

Firmware will need to be patched. Devices will be incompatible and obsolete. Entire services will rise and fall in months. 

The era of the "disrupted home" is coming.

## The risks

With this speed of innovation comes volatility and unpredictability. As a side effect we will likely see an increase in waste and exploitation. There will be vulnerabilities and breaches. If history can teach us anything, it is to expect these patterns - we have seen them in many waves of technological advances before. 

With that knowledge, we can approach the connected home with some understanding of what is to come. 

For example, let's look at security. As our built environment begins to change at the speed of software, our homes may experience new kinds of security vulnerabilities. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
A smart lock system is installed in your front door. The company who makes the locks goes bankrupt: There is no longer a support service to maintain your locks. At some point, your locks might get jammed, or hacked, or incompatible with your smartphone's latest update. You can no longer patch security bugs in your smart lock. And the lock on your front door is no longer in your control.    

These scenarios abound. As we make and use connected objects, we must consider how security can gracefully accompany the objects throughout their lifecycle - from installment to use and maintenance, to upgrading, to uninstalling and dismantling.

At some point, your lock gets jammed, or hacked or incompatible with your smartphone's latest update. You can no longer patch security bugs in your smart lock. Some of your personal information is compromised. And the lock on your front door is no longer in your control.    

These scenarios abound.[^2] As we make and use connected objects, we must take into account the lifecycles of these products and servces. How something ends is just as important as how it begins.[^3] Considerations such as security must be addressed not only at the moment of purpose, but in anticipation for how the object will be used for years to come. 

From installment, to use and maintenance, to upgrading, to uninstalling and dismantling, technology must be in service to humans and put our concerns and needs first.

## The home is for humans

<<<<<<< HEAD
There's an urgency to figure out these issues, and huge opportunity to innovate. In order to succeed, we need updated vocabularies, literacies, and ways to negotiate and resolve conflicts around the often thorny issues of data and sharing preferences.
 
Above all else, a home is a home. And as such, we need to approach all these issues not purely through a technological or design method but by putting humans first.

There's an urgency to figure out these issues. A lot is at stake, from our personal data, to safety and the health of our relationships and interactions at home.

As with the rise of smartphones, like many waves of technological change before it, with the rise of the connected home we will need updated vocabularies, literacies, ways to negotiate and resolve conflicts.

<<<<<<< HEAD
As of today, we're working under the assumption that it will take another 10 years or so for most homes to cross some kind of "connectedness threshold" - with the notable exception (and we're painting in broad strokes here) of Asia's mega cities, where often large-scale network infrastructure is dropped right into new buildings to a much higher degree than in many Western cities, where retro-fitting is a bigger thing.
=======
We will continue to explore concepts and scenarios that bring these risks and opportunities to life. And throughout, we will be guided by the understanding that above all else, no matter what technology can, the home is for the people living in it.

## What will a connected home look like?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Five or ten years from now the moment we enter a home might require some decisions from us: It might be a transition into a connected space, and it might not be obvious how connected it is, and in which ways. Yet, these are essential things to know to make an informed decision.
=======
There aren't many connected homes today. Similar to smartphone proliferation, it might take a decade for products to go from invention to widespread adoption. 
>>>>>>> origin/master

Exceptions may be in some cities, such as in South Korea, where large-scale network infrastructure is being installed directly into the new buildings. In other places, retro-fitting will be a more common path to connectedness, and that will likely move at a slower pace. 

For another glimpse of what the connected home may be like, we can examine the trajectories of other connected environments, such as **retail spaces, office buildings, and hotels.**  

These spaces tend to be interstitial, transactional contexts. Due to the generally temporary nature of our interactions in those spaces, we tend to use them with less emotional investment and critical thinking than our homes. For example, in a high street store, we may be more accepting of privacy-diminishing interactions[^4] if they come with financial gain or if they seem, frankly, unavoidable.

Our retail environments, as well as offices and transportation spaces, should communicate how connected they are and in which ways. We should be able to make an informed decision whether to enter and what information we consent to giving.

<<<<<<< HEAD
An overt approach would be labeling: A set of icons that indicate what is collecting data, what is transmitting data, what is analyzing data. What reacts, what just does its thing without requiring our oversights. Which spaces in the apartment are "dead zones" of perfect privacy.

![icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/understanding-the-connected-home/book/master/img/icons.png)

_The blunt approach of labeling: A set of icons that indicate what is collecting data, what is transmitting data, what is analyzing data. "Does this thing listen or watch? Does it share data to the cloud?" Some possible connected device engagement icons.[^2]_

Labeling does not, of course, scale in the least. It is inelegant, entirely undesirable and takes too much active consideration to be practical in day to day life. It is not, in other words, legible enough to serve its purpose: Just like a legal contract offers all relevant information but isn't really, truly "human-readable", this wouldn't quite do the trick.

Maybe a direct machine-to-machine approach might be more powerful: We set our personal preferences (pur own ground rules) that are saved in a device we always have on ourselves (phones, fitness tracker...) and the home transmits its own ground rules. Algorithmically, both negotiate what's going to happen based on ground rules that we have established as social norms. This is certainly interesting. But it also is a highly technical solution, which brings its own set of complications.

If, for example, a person chooses not to have or use the device or app that transmits their personal ID and preferences, the system might not recognize them. The person might, for all practical purposes, not exist as far as the house is concerned, much like the Nest thermostat doesn't necessarily play well with multi-person households in which not everyone uses the Nest app.

## We need to develop a vocabulary for these kind of interactions

Currently, these are all just questions: A kind of stream of consciousness that sounds banal at best and creepy at worst. None of these scenarios sound desirable. Before we can focus on the opportunities that a connected home can offer - for ways a smart home can help us be more human, more ourselves - we might need to evolve a vocabulary for all the many types of interactions we will be increasingly facing. Otherwise our questions and answers are bound not to fit the challenges we want to consider.

To understand and communicate the ground rules for the connected home, we need to find the words to describe them.

## Privacy as opportunity

We see privacy as an opportunity both in terms of a design constraint and as a way for companies to positively differentiate themselves from their competition.

By going way beyond the EU's General Data Protection Regulation[^3] players in the connected home market can proactively build in stronger privacy protections and earn consumers' trust.


## Our homes must respect us

On the web, our behavior is constantly tracked by advertising companies and other, even less savory organizations. This happens almost entirely without our consent, frequently under dubious ethical and legal practices, largely without recourse. 

On the web, the only means of protection are personal education in the matter (to at least understand what's going on) as well as technical measures, like ad & tracking blockers, as well as browser features/plug-ins like Do Not Track. **Between them, these measures provide a certain measure of privacy, but neither is this sufficient nor is it sufficiently easy.** We got to this point because for too long, the open nature of the web allowed bad players to foster a culture of tracking without recourse or penalties. 

**For the context of the connected home, we must not commit these same mistakes. We need to establish standards, regulatory frameworks and a culture that respects the ethical dimensions of the safe place that is the home.**

As for adaption of connectivity inside our homes, we have no doubt that it will happen. Not out of some techno-deterministic world view, but because we learned over the last couple of decades that connectivity & data add value to all parts of our lives if done right. 

We assume that the ways this will happen might need some getting used to, and that it will happen not along the lines of well-established metaphors like automation or personalization: These will likely seem as quirky and ridiculous in hindsight as the futuristic computerized kitchen did in the 1950s (both in terms of gender roles and the technological aspects).

Rather, the smartness will manifest in ways both banal and novel, and the vector will (hopefully, and most likely) be smarts that are "on the user", in whichever way. If we had to guess, we'd say they will be probably fairly low-tech, bottom up interventions that just make things a little easier, more interesting, more useful: **A connected home should help us be more human, more ourselves.**

Much more tricky is how we will deal with our preferences regarding various levels of scanning, sharing data, and (by extension) surveillance.

### Automation is a natural first step

The connected home products we see on the market today (or judging by conversations with many manufacturers and designers working in the field, on the way to market) focus to a large degree on home automation. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a natural first step. It's (comparatively) simple and offers a clear value (if done right), so it's (again, comparatively) low-hanging fruit.

Maybe more importantly, automation does not require a lot of explanation: _I used to regulate my heater by hand, now it self-regulates._ Simple to understand, no explanation needed.

Inarguably, there's a lot to be gained for users from home automation. Nobody would argue with the convenience and time savings of a laundry machine, a dishwasher or a vacuum cleaner. 

The same will hold true for many connected home appliances. The true automation magic might, however, not happen at the device level. Everyone who ever had to install one smartphone app per connected home device - thermostat, lightbulb, smart lock - will agree, the trick might turn out to be smart integration at the software layer: One app to rule them all.[^4]

San Francisco-based startup [Thington](http://thington.com/) offers a simple concierge-like interface that aims to bring all smart home devices into one app based on their APIs. It's an easy-to-use approach with intelligent, well-designed interactions. Other approaches that are even more explicitly conversational include the smart home hubs Amazon Echo and Google Home, both of which bring voice control into the home (and fold their respective mother companies' services right in).
=======
Increasingly, we will be faced with these decisions upon entering a home.  

## Privacy as opportunity

Already our behavior in many spaces is being tracked. As we move through the city, into stores and offices, in transit and on our devices, many systems are recording what we look at, what we click on and what we do. 

On the web, advertising companies are particularly aggressive in how they track us. Through consumer education and browser tools like ad blockers and Do Not Track, we can mitigate these tracking measures a bit. However, it is basically an arms race in online advertising, where we as users get the short end of the stick: our privacy is increasingly eroded and our web experiences slowed down as ad companies try to ensure we are humans and serve us tailored ads.[^6] 

**In our homes, we should not have to fight the same battles against trackers.** 

For anyone making connected products today, there is a huge opportunity to build in better privacy. Companies can innovate by offering high default settings, better controls over how personal data is collected and shared, as well as assurances when data is deleted. These will be features that people increasingly seek out, as the prevailing practices of tracking in our online lives and in public spaces encroaches into our home. 

The future is one that promises augmentation. But the only kind of connection and augmentation we want is one that we can fully read, control and participate in, and then, whenever we want, turn off.
