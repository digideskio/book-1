# Who has root access to your home?


The first two are pretty straight forward, ethically speaking: Rights management needs to be super simple and understandable, and malware - legal or illegal - is unacceptable when it grants access to a home without permission of the residents. Malware should be considered a security issue.

It's the cases around root access that we find most interesting and threatening. It's likely that all kinds of parties will try to leverage control over an apartment against its residents. To mention just a few examples of how this could go all kinds of wrong, consider the following scenarios:

- We have already seen cases where [leased cars won't start](https://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/class-war-meets-the-war-on-gen.html) if the lease payments are overdue - a truly malicious, out of proportion invasion of privacy. 
- Imagine a health insurance that will track if a diabetic takes any sweet beverage or food out of the fridge, and reports back or blocks access to the fridge to begin with.
- What happens if a crooked land lord pressures residents to move out by messing with the houses lighting and heating systems?

This is where we'll see truly ugly power struggles play out. This is going to get ugly before it gets better.
