# The home as the next augmentative technology

* Augmentation over time. Mouse to smartphone to home. Tech's role to augment humans. 

Prior to the rise of connected devices, human-to-computer interaction was primarily based on a single user interacting with a single computer. Now, in the connected home, there are multiple users interacting with multiple computers, sometimes separated by physical distance, time and preferences. 

> * multimodality rather than unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces rather than command/action based ones, and finally active rather than passive interfaces

These are complex interactions, with opportunities for innovation and possible unintended consequences. 

At the same time, we're looking at how our homes will be "updated" at very different time scales: from the building's architecture which is usually measured in decades, to the building infrastructure such as electricity, plumbing etc which is measured in years, to interior furniture and design in fewer years, to devices and appliances in 18-month cycles to digital services and apps which can be just months.
