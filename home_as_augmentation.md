# The home as the next augmentative technology

In the past, human-to-machine interaction was modeled primarily on a single user interacting with a single machine. Inventions like the computer mouse signaled how computers would begin to augment our lives. Meanwhile, while computing technology changed rapidly, the lifespans of our built environment were still long. And most use cases for the "home of the future" were about automation, not augmentation. 

Today, multiple users interact with multiple machines to form complex computational networks. Through simplified physical interfaces, the Internet of Things can offer users better understanding and control of data. Now the foundation of digital augmentation is in the hands of billions of people thanks to their first IoT device: a smartphone.

Smartphones are a sign of the speed of change that our homes may soon face. As our built environment enters the rapid lifecyles of software, it brings risks such as security vulnerabilities and broken devices. There's an urgency to address these issues now, as well as innovation opportunities, to ensure throughout that the home remains a place that puts humans first.
