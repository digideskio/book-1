# Shared connected objects 

As anyone who's lived in a shared household can attest, there will be objects that you share with others. 

Be it the TV remote, a book, the dining room table, or even the dishes, the connected home will not doubt be **filled with objects that will be used by multiple people,** sometimes simultaneously and sometimes even without the owners permission.  

> On the whole, you find wealth much more in use than in ownership. — Aristotle

## Rival vs. non-rival goods

What will these shared, connected objects be like? What characteristics will define them? 

Furthermore, when we imagine objects being shared, what if we think about them being used not only within one household, but with neighbors, friends and even the broader world? 

Normally, physical objects are "rival goods." That means if one person has it, no one else can have it. For example, I'm reading a paperback book, and unless you're comfortable reading over someone's shoulder, it's not possible for you to read the book at the same time. 

However, with digital things, these are "non-rival goods." That means if I'm reading a digital copy of this book, you can also have a copy on your device that you're reading at the same time. 


## Characteristics of shared connected objects 

If this stage of climate change has taught us anything, it's that we should design for things to be used (and reused) to their fullest. That means we have the opportunity to think afresh about objects.


* **Personalize shared objects.** Are you familiar with these phones that hold multiple SIM cards? Those are really common in places like Africa where one device is used by multiple people. But each person inserts their own SIM card and all their address books and personal settings are ready for them. The personalization follows the user, not the device. Can we apply this to other devices and services? Cars, printers, refrigerator, coffee machines, or even drills?

**Idling Capacity.** This is about spare cycles. All the unused, material surplus that bolsters collaborative consumption. And it not just about products that sit unused on storage shelves, but also untapped skills, times, spaces. These resources have to be available, like in the drill example, and sharable.

**Commons Governance.** For these platforms to work, you need appropriate mechanisms for collaboration within legal, social and technical frameworks. There are great tools for this, and definitely the potential to develop more. Conflict resolution has to be cheap and easy, and resource providers need ways to participate in the decision-making process.

**Trust.** This is one of the most important pillars of collaborative consumption. Without trust, you don’t have continued and meaningful participation and growth. Trust has to be cultivated and facilitated. It’s not just available instantly, but grows organically through the service and positive experiences. Clearly defined boundaries of who’s participating and a way to key at bay trolls, spammers, and frauds, and other elements that harm the community. This requires effective monitoring and reputation management, plus graduated sanctions for people who violate community rules.

## Designing shared objects

Building upon these principles and characteristics, I want to offer you a few design challenges.

* **Create open layers.** Think about interoperability across key components. How can you use open standards to enable remix, modification, and improvements across products? How can open layers be applied to motors, power cords, outlets, connectors, joints, nibs for maximal customization and range of use?

* **Build modularity.** Relatedly, shared objects should be easy to repair and amend. You shouldn’t have to throw away your entire phone because it’s scratched. Building modularity means fostering generativity.

* **Value added through usage.** I think this is one of the most powerful design challenges. Think about an object that doesn’t depreciate with use, but is instead improved by it. One example is a baseball mitt. When you first buy it, it’s very stiff and hard to catch a ball with. Over time, with use, it becomes more flexible and a better product.

* **[Data usage.]** That’s just on the physical layer. What about value added on a data layer? Think about how objects can learn from behaviors the more they’re used. Like by collecting more data points. Or where the user contributes metadata, like marginalia, reviews, and fact checking for books.



* **Diversify Libraries.** Libraries are not just for books. Think about other ways to pool resources, be it for commercial or community aims. You could have tool libraries, or ones for electronics, cooking appliances, moving boxes/materials, jewelry and accessories, holiday decorations, toys, you name it.
