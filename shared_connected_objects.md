# Shared connected objects 

As anyone who's lived in a shared household can attest, there will be objects that you share with others. 

Be it the TV remote, a book, the dining room table, or even the dishes, the connected home will not doubt be **filled with objects that will be used by multiple people,** sometimes simultaneously and sometimes even without the owners permission.  

> On the whole, you find wealth much more in use than in ownership. — Aristotle

## Rival vs. non-rival goods

What will these shared, connected objects be like? What characteristics will define them? 

Furthermore, when we imagine objects being shared, what if we think about them being used not only within one household, but with neighbors, friends and even the broader world? Even at the same time? 
Normally, **physical objects are "rival goods."** That means if one person has it, no one else can have it. For example, I'm reading a paperback book, and unless you're comfortable reading over someone's shoulder, it's not possible for you to read the book at the same time. 

However, **digital things are often "non-rival goods."** That means if I'm reading a digital copy of this book, you can also have a copy on your device that you're reading at the same time. 

**When we add connectivity to an object, could we start to use physical resources in a non-rival way?**

This seems like an incredible opportunity for allocating resources and using them in a responsible and sustainable way. 

How can we build and use objects in the connected home so that others can use them as well? 

## Personalization

If we're going to be sharing connected objects, we may want to personalize them when we're using them. 

How can we design objects that support multiple users, for example managing different preferences or appearances depending on who's using it. 

Even if you have one person using a connected object, they may want to switch between different user personas. Today it's common to see phones with two SIM cards. This allows the user to toggle the phone plan and operator, plus other preferences, that suit them. 

Could we apply this kind of personalization to other devices and services, like household appliances, furniture and even environmental controls? 

## Trust management

If we have pseudo-non-rival goods being shared, how do we facilitate trust? It might be easy to trust your family living in the home with you, but what if you lend your connected drill to a friend of a friend, or offer it in a neighbor tool forum? 

We'll have to build ways to delineate to whom you grant permission to use your objects. There will be ways to protect those objects from spam and fraud, as well as monitoring usage so that you can ensure it's been treated well. 


## Designing shared objects

Building upon these principles and characteristics, I want to offer you a few design challenges.

* **Create open layers.** Think about interoperability across key components. How can you use open standards to enable remix, modification, and improvements across products? How can open layers be applied to motors, power cords, outlets, connectors, joints, nibs for maximal customization and range of use?

* **Build modularity.** Relatedly, shared objects should be easy to repair and amend. You shouldn’t have to throw away your entire phone because it’s scratched. Building modularity means fostering generativity.

* **Value added through usage.** I think this is one of the most powerful design challenges. Think about an object that doesn’t depreciate with use, but is instead improved by it. One example is a baseball mitt. When you first buy it, it’s very stiff and hard to catch a ball with. Over time, with use, it becomes more flexible and a better product.

* **[Data usage.]** That’s just on the physical layer. What about value added on a data layer? Think about how objects can learn from behaviors the more they’re used. Like by collecting more data points. Or where the user contributes metadata, like marginalia, reviews, and fact checking for books.



* **Diversify Libraries.** Libraries are not just for books. Think about other ways to pool resources, be it for commercial or community aims. You could have tool libraries, or ones for electronics, cooking appliances, moving boxes/materials, jewelry and accessories, holiday decorations, toys, you name it.
