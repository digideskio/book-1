# Mediating across layers

How can interactions and understanding be mediated across the human-readable and machine-readable layers? Here we discuss the idea of a "user agent" that translates and negotiates across the layers. Historically, this has been metaphor-based software (GUIs) like the browser or mobile operating system. It might look different going forward. 

## Negotiation

**Whenever we enter or leave a connected environment, some type of data engagement will take place.** Whether it is opt-in or opt-out or something more granular, whether it is an all-or-nothing, binary choice like a EULA, or something negotiated between humans or software agents: **We need to find ways to make this type of interaction and exchange understandable, human- and machine-readable, and negotiable.**

It seems better to discuss today how to get this right, or at least how to ask the right questions that will arise tomorrow.
