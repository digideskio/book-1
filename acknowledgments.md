**Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino** has been blogging about and building products for the internet of things for over ten years. There's no one to whom we're more indebted for helping us understand the connected home and the current challenges and trends. 

A huge thank you to **Jasmina Tesanovic and Bruce Sterling** for their kind hospitality at Casa Jasmina and truly inspiring project. We are so grateful to be a part of it.

Grazie mille to the whole Arduino team especially **Lorenzo Romagnoli  and Davide Gomba** for hosting us and making us feel so welcome in Torino. 

It's also such a pleasure to think about and tinker with the connected home together with **Jon Rogers** from the University of Dundee. From faciliating workshops, to inviting us to Fife, and to always bringing a collaborative, open spirit to everything he does, we can't wait to keep exploring the future with you. 

A big thank you for lovely, inspiring and informative chats to **Matt Webb**, **Matt Biddulph** and **Tom Coates**.

**Louisa Heinrich** and **Scott Smith** have been doing tremendous work in this field, and conversations with them, as well as their massive output, have been priceless. Thank you! Please read & watch everything they produce. 

A big shoutout to the **Max Krüger, Simon Höher, and Emanuel Schwarz** as fellow conference chairs of ThingsCon. You all are always thinking about how to make great events around this topic. It's amazing working with you.
