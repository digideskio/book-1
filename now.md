# Now and the future

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

Now we're seeing the rise of plurals: multiple users and multiple machines. These form complex, connected systems, experiences, and data sets. 


## There aren't many connected homes

Over the last few months, we've made a point of asking a lot of people which connected objects they have in their houses (not counting smartphones, tablets, laptops). It wasn't many. 

Even in this almost ludicrously biased-towards-early-adopters group We talked to you hardly find any connectedness: Some game consoles and smart TVs, yes. Some NEST thermostats, a Philips Hue lightbulb here and there, sure. But that was about it. (In our home, there are some bluetooth speakers and we had a set of Alex's lovely [Good Night Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com) before we brought them to [Casa Jasmina](http://casajasmina.arduino.cc) as house warming gifts. That's just about it.)

The reasons are simple, and even this group of early adopters - many of who design connected products and services for a living - everybody has been blunt about it: The current offerings offer (mostly) fairly marginal value, or aren't compatible with either other technical platforms or (more interestingly) social norms. 

**If we had to summarize the overall response in one sentence, it'd be: "I just don't need it."**

And that's _very_ interesting. Because everybody agrees there's a huge market in connecting the home, and most would simultaneously agree that as a user the things offered don't make a whole lot of sense at least to the wider public.

<strong>The home is first and foremost a safe space. A place of retreat and relaxation. A space that must never be challenging, but supportive. If we add any complexity or complication to the home, we chip away at its core functionality.</strong>


## How will the connected home start?

In a recent conversation a software developer friend asked where we see the smart home going, where we were standing on the issue: It's hard to tell. 

One the one hand we're convinced that connectivity will definitively seep in to our homes, like it does everywhere else. On the other hand we find the current manifestations somewhere along the spectrum between "somewhat boring" and "super creepy". 

So the way we're approaching this whole field is with as much of a beginner's mind as we can: Trying to figure out what the questions are that we need to ask; what the real issues are. 

As for adaption of connectivity inside our homes, we have no doubt that it will happen. Not out of some techno-deterministic world view, but because we learned over the last couple of decades that connectivity & data add value to all parts of our lives if done right. 

We assume that the ways this will happen will seem odd for a while, and that it will happen not along the lines of well-established metaphors like automation or personalization: These will likely seem as quirky and ridiculous in hindsight as the futuristic computerized kitchen did in the 1950s (both in terms of gender roles and the technological aspects):

Rather, the smart will manifest in ways both banal and novel, and the vector will (hopefully, and most likely) be smarts that are "on the user", in whichever way. If we had to guess, we'd say they will be probably fairly low-tech, bottom up interventions that just make things a little easier, more interesting, more useful: **A connected home should help us be more human, more ourselves.**
