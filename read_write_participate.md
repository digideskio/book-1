# Read, Write and Participate

_As a matter of empowerment, people should be able to read, write and participate fully in their connected home._

## DONE

Everyone should be able to understand how the connected systems in their homes work. And from that understanding, everyone should have the ability to modify and adapt these systems to meet their needs and fully participate in their connected home. 

To achieve that, users need both the skills to interact with these systems (literacy)[^1] as well as the technical features and functions that enable these interactions.

## Read
 
Users can see connected systems and understand how its parts interrelate. This includes aspects like being able to see actionable, contextual data and visbility in what happens in the system after certain actions are taken.

In practice, "reading" the connected home may be about recognizing common visual cues. Perhaps these cues are standardized symbols displayed on connected objects, or status lights that indicate what's happening to your data, or whether an object is actively listening to audio inputs.

The ability to "read" also applies to data that the home generates. These data sets could include maintence reports, electricity usage, connectivity maps and more. 

Users in the home should be able to read, evaluate and manipulate these datasets as well as understand the algorithms that create and compute with them.  

## Write

Users should be able to modify their connected home, including the data and algorigthms in it, as well as create new ones.

We should be able to query APIs in our home and to build bespoke services on top of them. It should also be possible to identify data that has been modified by other members of the household and to navigate permissions to accept or edit those changes. 


## Participate

Lastly, we should be empowered to fully participate in connected home and the data infrastructure that powers and augments it. This touches on aspects like sharing, collaborating, and open practices.

How can "connected home data" be documented and distributed to other households or contributed to the commons? For example, a home might generate interesting data about the local weather, which it can share with the neighborhood or national weather service. People in the home should be able to understand these kinds of contributions and participate in them when they choose. 

Furthermore, how can people cultivate healthy relationships with the people they live with and next to through (and sometimes in spite of) connected systems? How can preferences be expressed and conflicts resolved in a way that gives individuals agency and control?

As our homes become more connected, we must preserve the ability to read, write and participate fully in them.

An open source motto says: If you can't open it, you don't own it. We should all be able to open--and change--the things in our homes.
