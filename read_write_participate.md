# Read/Write/Participate

_As a matter of empowerment, residents should be able to read, write and participate fully in their connected home._

## WRITTEN: P
## PROOFED?

Residents should be able to understand how their homes work. This is a question of simple empowerment: Everyone should have the power to adapt their homes to their needs.

To be full citizens of the internet, we need web literacy. Consider the three aspects of web literacy, the abilities to:

- Read: navigation, web mechanics, search, credibility and security. 
- Write: composing, remixing, designing, coding/scripting, and accessibility.
- Participate: sharing, collaborating, participation, privacy and open practices.

For the connected home, we need the equivalent. Consider three aspects of connected home literacy[^1], the abilities to:

**Read**
Making systems visible to users can help them understand it. This includes (but isn't limited to) aspects like allowing users to see actionable, contextual data as much as favoring the transparency inherent in open practices over a black box approach.

It will be important to recognize common visual cues in these services. Maybe those are standardized symbols on the objects in your home that explain what's happening to your data, or how to turn them on and off.

It also apply to data in the home, which residents should be able to read, evaluate and manipulate. This requires to know the role algorithms play in creating and managing the home. 


**Write**
Users should be able to modify their connected home including the data and algorigthms in it and make them their own.

How can residents identify content and data that that might be modified? What will be the techniques and conditions needed to combine this data to create something new? How can they change style, layout, and functionality of the connected environment? How can they improve their user experience? How can they query their home's APIs and build on top of them?


**Participate**
Residents should be empowered to fully participate in connected home and the data infrastructure that powers and augments it. This touches on aspects like sharing, collaborating, and open practices.

How can they distribute "connected home content" and data to others or contribute to data commons? How can they make informed choices about what platforms and tools to use for their homes, and contribute to as well as improve or modify these platforms? How does co-creation work in the connected home? How can residents control metadata shared online, be in control their rights retained or removed in user agreements, and manage their home-related online identities? How can they, in other words, contribute to and advocate for a healthy connected home ecosystems? 


As the old motto of the open source movement says: If you can't open it, you don't own it. We should all be able to open the infrastructure that powers our homes.
