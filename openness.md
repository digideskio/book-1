Open practices lead to more open and robust, resilient, and participatory products. For creators of connected products, we advocate for open practices & technologies and learning together as a professional learning community.

**Open practices lead to better connected products.**

Best practices from the free & open source (FOSS) movement - both in software and hardware - fully apply to the connected home. 

**Quality control**
Especially the positive effects of increased transparency and decentralized **quality control** can add essential additional security to connected homes. Consider this as a rule of thumb: Bugs in proprietary software and apps are bad (or at least annoying) but often users can work around them. Bugs and security holes in your home are much worse, and due to the nature of networked complex computational systems tend to compound. In other words, **security, resilience, and strong code is key for the connected home.**

**Diversity & inclusion**
Open practices allow for **participation and hence a more diverse group of stakeholders**. Diversity and inclusion are key if we want to connect homes: The home is a place that is particularly strongly shaped by **cultural context**.

**Design & empowerment**
Open practices should not just apply to the hardware and software layer, ie. the technology. They should apply just as much to design, networking and learning.

The open design movement is younger than FOSS, but has well established ground rules and shown great promise over the last few years. Open design practices combined with the manufacturing infrastructure that emerged out of the maker movement  empower residents to maintain, fix, adapt, modify and improve their connected homes: With an open source code base and open design resources, more and more people will be able to work with FabLabs, maker spaces, online lasercutting, 3d printing services and the like to improve their connected homes.

**Networking & APIs**
Services and products in the connected home should be as open as possible. Where full open source is not an option, a strong and well documented API can offer interconnectivity. If your connected home products is neither open nor has an API you might want to go back to the drawing board.

**Sharing & learning**
On the meta level, we encourage designers and developers to share as much of their process and their proposed solutions as possible. In a field as young and unexplored at the connected home there is tremendous value to be gained by pooling code, designs, and insights. Openness and sharing always encourages innovation - in an area as nascent as this, this holds especially true.
