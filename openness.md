# Openness

## DONE

*Open practices lead to more robust, resilient, and participatory products. For creators of connected products, we advocate for open technologies as well as open practices that contribute to professional learning communities.*

## Open practices for better connected products

Best practices from the free & open source (FOSS) movement—both in software and hardware—fully apply to the connected home. 

## Quality control

Especially the positive effects of increased transparency and decentralized quality control can add essential additional security to connected homes. 

Consider this as a rule of thumb: Bugs in proprietary software and apps are bad (or at least annoying) but often users can work around them. Bugs and security holes in your home are much worse, and due to the nature of networked complex computational systems, these bugs tend to compound. 

In other words, security, resilience, and strong code is key for the connected home.

## Diversity & inclusion

The home is a place that is particularly strongly shaped by cultural context and the "users" in it. 

Open practices enable people to participate in the creation and use of technologies in their home. This accessibility fosters inclusion and brings diverse perspectives to what a connected home is for and what it can do.   

## Design & empowerment

Open practices apply not just to the making of hardware and software, but also to how we design and learning about the connected home.

Open design practices, combined with democratized manufacturing thanks to the maker movement, empower the residents of a home to maintain, fix, adapt, modify and improve their connected homes. 

Home improvement takes on a new dimension when paired with open source code bases and open design resources, plus open networks of people learning and teaching each other how to hack their connected homes.

## Networking & APIs

Services and products in the connected home should be as open as possible. An API enables others to bridge services and build new things by mashing up products. 

Where full open source is not an option, a strong and well documented API can offer interconnectivity. 

## Sharing & learning

On the meta level, we encourage designers and developers to share as much of their learning, process and solutions as possible. 

In a field as young and unexplored at the connected home, there is tremendous value to be gained by pooling insights, code, and designs. Openness and sharing encourages innovation as well as professional development and portfolio-building. 

In aggregate, these open practices will create a more robust and welcoming ecosystem for the connected home.
