# Policy matters: The connected home and the smart city

_Connected homes exist within the larger framework of a smart city, and we need to design both services and policies to make this work for citizens._

In this book, we focus primarily on home as a connected environment. But as is the nature of networked systems, they do not exist independently but rather in context. This hold especially here, where data is (at least potentially) exchanged between systems in real time: We need to consider a smart home in the context of the smart city.

> We need to consider a smart home in the context of the smart city.

How does a connected home interact with an increasingly smart city? How do we want the two systems to interact?

These seemingly harmless question are loaded as they touch upon core functions of privacy, data ownership, and participation. Each of these are huge fields that require us to drill deeper, and each with implications for different groups and professions, like:

**Designers** of products and services might want to extend their services into the other real, to make sure their ideas reach from the city into the home and vice versa. How to build human-centric systems and interactions that create value at the intersection between inside and outside the home? How to design the data-aspects of the home's threshold? 

**Data scientists and software developers** both might wanted what data models are applicable and appropriate to use in this context, and which standards to adopt.

**Startups and entrepreneurs** might want to explore how to build useful, desirable products that create and capture value when transactions take place between the two systems. Some scenarious to consider:
	- Urban mobility & data
	- Energy consumption and production data
	- Real estate, lease, and holiday rental scenarios

**Policy makers** around the globe are working hard to understand the implications of what it means to make a city "smart" as they start pilot projects and draft smart city policies.

## Policies for smart cities & connected homes

Earlier this year, the German federal government released a major report about the future of urbanization. [^1] As part of this report, Prof. Dr. Christoph Bieber and I were commissioned to contribute an expert study on the implications of the smart city for citizens (as opposed to vendors and other commercial entities). [^2]

Many of the questions explored in our study there apply directly also to the connected home, or offer avenues of exploring this context further as they tap directly into larger questions of participation, ownership, and resilience:

> What does digitalization mean for the urban context today? What happens to cities when infrastructure, public space and citizens are becoming increasingly technologically networked, tracked by sensor networks, and part of a rich data ecosystem?

> The various elements of a data-smart city and its integration into urban culture are to be recognized as a part of urban governance structures. Aspects such as sustainable development, education, inclusion, transparency and openness deserve attention accordingly. 

> The path to increased security and resilience of the smart city must include transparency and the principles of open source. Strong data sovereignty of citizens is the basis for participation and problem solving competence – especially when facing possible technological problems of digital urban infrastructure.

> A city that is measured and sensed through sensors, cameras and other survey systems is always a city under surveillance that could discipline its citizens. This means a conflict between problematic surveillance and control on one side positive knowledge and data based opportunities on the other. The ambivalence of the potentials that threaten democracy and those that foster it need to be reevaluated constantly.

 
As a little playful exploration, let us replace "city/urban" with "home", "public" with "private" and re-read these sentences:

> What does digitalization mean for the <strike>urban</strike> home context today? What happens to <strike>cities</strike> homes when infrastructure, <strike>public space</strike> private spaces and citizens are becoming increasingly technologically networked, tracked by sensor networks, and part of a rich data ecosystem?

> The various elements of a data-smart <strike>city</strike> home and its integration into urban culture are to be recognized as a part of urban governance structures. Aspects such as sustainable development, education, inclusion, transparency and openness deserve attention accordingly. 

> The path to increased security and resilience of the smart <strike>city</strike> home must include transparency and the principles of open source. Strong data sovereignty of citizens is the basis for participation and problem solving competence – especially when facing possible technological problems of digital <strike>urban</strike> home infrastructure.

> A <strike>city</strike> home that is measured and sensed through sensors, cameras and other survey systems is always a <strike>city</strike> home under surveillance that could discipline its <strike>citizens</strike> residents. This means a conflict between problematic surveillance and control on one side positive knowledge and data based opportunities on the other. The ambivalence of the potentials that threaten democracy and those that foster it need to be reevaluated constantly.

Not all of these simple replacements fit 100 percent. And yet you get the idea: The larger issues, threats and opportunities all apply to the context of the connected home to some degree. And in building connections and connectedness across the boundary between the two - in strengthening the data flow between both worlds - the lines increasingly blur. 

What happens inside the home is part of the larger cityscape, and now it is measurable in real time, too.

## We need policies for the connected home

Lawmakers are have long been playing catch up with technology: To some degree, this is in the nature of things. However, we do need sensible policies as a framework to govern connected systems as sensitive as the connected home.

As part of our smart city report we drafted some guidelines that could serve as basis for smart city policies.

These guidelines, in turn, are inspired by the *de facto* principles that shaped the open web in its early days:  open source, openness, decentralization, bottom-up innovation. 

For connected homes, these same principles might apply, with one difference: There should be a stronger focus on privacy and data protection.
