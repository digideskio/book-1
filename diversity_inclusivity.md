# Diversity and inclusivity

_The connected home is a safe space and must be designed with diversity and inclusivity in mind. This includes challenging assumptions about cultural context as much as taking into account socio-economic factors, gender and other forms of identity._

## DONE

The home must be a safe space. That means its residents must have the ability to shape it regardless of, and in response to, their gender, religion, language, ethnicity, origin, professional background, socio-economic factors or age.

This is no simple feat. Connected products and the code running them manifest values as well as biases and assumptions, as do their underlying business models.

When a connected home product is designed, the team might ask themselves questions like:

- What do our users look like?
- What are their needs, requirements, desires?
- What are they likely to want to use our product for?
- How do we expect them to interact with our system?
- How will we listen to and adapt based on what users actually go?

All of these are good starting questions, but they might not suffice. We think it is just as important to ask:

- How can we make sure this product doesn't just work well for an average user, but all users? What do our "edge cases" look like?
- How can our product degrade gracefully if it's modified, adapted, hacked? How if the business model changes or the company goes bankrupt?
- How can we make sure to design for a wide range of cultural contexts, for example with various numbers of users, across languages, and for different expectations of privacy?
- How can we make sure to allow for socio-economic inclusion?
- How can we design for gender inclusivity and equality?[^1]

One way to designing for diversity and inclusion is to have a diverse team designing the product as well as testing it. 

Including ethnographers and anthropologists also can add a lot of value. 

And finally, it's worth remembering that a product made with diversity and inclusivity in mind also means it has a much larger potential user base, so it makes sense from a business perspective as much as an ethics perspective.

[^1]: This starts from more straightforward solutions like dropping binary gender user profiles (*male/female* should not be the only option) or not asking for gendered user profiles to begin with (consider if they are really required for the core product), and goes into much complex questions of roles and power dynamics surrounding gender in the larger context of domesticity. Also, obviously, marketing.
