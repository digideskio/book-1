# Interactions

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

Interactions take place across layers. Some are human-readable, some are machine-readable, and some are both. This book looks primarily at the human-readable layers. 

"Readability" = shorthand for read/write/participate

Each of these interactions will require protocols and conflict resolution, as well as **layers of interpretation** that help each other understand what's going on and how to interact with it.

* human-readable
* machine-readable
* new layers, i.e. environment-readable
