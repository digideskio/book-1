# Machine-readable

How machines talk to each other is a place for a lot of technical research and standards building. This book lightly covers it. 

## Machines <> Machines

There are considerations around metadata that conveys humans' preferences, ways for machines to talk better with one another, and ways of structuring the network to facilitate this. [principle to include here: humans should have the ability to still see/manipulate what's going on here]

## Going forward

Should machines be able to read human <> human interactions to offer contextual services?
