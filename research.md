**What's beyond automation and personalization?**
Automation and personalization are just two possible vectors through which connectedness enters the connected home. We'd like to throw into the mix some other aspects - other vectors for further inquiry if you will. All of these aspects might have an impact on the way we live with our connected homes and vice versa. Let's not forget about: health, privacy, data ownership, citizenship, EULAs and consumer rights, data mobility, smart city, connected car, mobility, engagement with the urban fabric and with connected vehicles, layered services, identity, gender, research, analytics, insurance, accessibility, wellness, emotional states, context-based services, algorithms and AI, societal value, IP, openness, interoperability, robustness. To name just a few.

**Network models for the connected home**
How do we handle connectivity in the connected home? This is not just a question of networking standards and protocols but also one of architecture: Which network model - or more concretely, which logical network topology - is the best fit? Depending on the model, different actors (hardware manufacturers, software developers, standards) are allowed to have more or less power over the network - and hence our homes. 

**What are the social impacts of the connected home?**
The home has always been a focal point of gender and power dynamics. What is the impact of connectedness and how can we use this transition phase to promote equality, diversity and inclusion?

**Policy**
Policy makers are paying more attention to smart city policy, which is a good thing. But they are struggling to keep up with an industdy that pushes ahead quickly. We need to work with policy makers to create better poicies governing connectedness in its many facets.
