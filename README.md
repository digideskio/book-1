# Intro

In May 2015, Science Fiction author Bruce Sterling gave a keynote at [ThingsCon](http://thingscon.com), a conference about the internet of things and maker culture that Peter co-organizes in Berlin. In his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vtwoUugXrQ), Bruce introduced a new project he had been working on with his partner Jasmina Tesanovic: [Casa Jasmina](http://casajasmina.arduino.cc)[^1], the open source connected home of the future. It's a unique research project, an open source investigation of the connected home.

> It's time to live the life. Just go ahead and build the products and see if you can survive being in a room with them. This is our test bed.
-- Bruce Sterling at ThingsCon

A few weeks later, in June 2015, we flew to Turin, Italy, along with [Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino](http://designswarm.com), to visit Casa Jasmina and spend some time with the team, and to see how it would be to live in this home of the future. Because that is what the Casa aims to be: A live-in lab that lets visitors live in the future for a few days, and see what works and what needs fixing: to see if they can survive being in a room with connected products. For that reason, visitors are also invited to bring connected things. We brought a family of Alexandra's [Good Night Lamps](http://goodnightlamp.com) (and knew from experience that you cannot just survive being in a room with them, but that it is in fact very lovely).

Ever since [visiting Casa Jasmina](http://www.thewavingcat.com/2015/07/22/visiting-casa-jasmina/) one question we discussed there wouldn't leave us alone - there literally hasn't been a day where the topic hasn't come up, where we haven't been trying to get closer to figuring out answers, or at least better questions: How do we interact with a connected home? How does the space, and the things in it, communicate what's expected of the person, what the ground rules are, what requires interaction and what doesn't? How, in other word, do we know how connected a home is, and in which way?

In various conversations we asked a great number people for their thoughts on the topic, all of whom are very smart and many of whom have a great deal of experience in related matters, with background as varied as interaction designer to artificial intelligence researcher to chip engineer to journalist: It slowly emerged that it's an area that might just not be fully explored yet. An area that in fact we have just begun to explore at all.

And yet, we know that connectivity increasingly makes its way into our living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms. Into our smoke detectors, lights, door locks, kitchen scales and ovens. We bring in more connectivity through fitness tracking wristbands and our phones and tablets, and take it along when we get into the driving computers that are our cars.

**Understanding the connected home and the decisions that go into designing it, as well as its impact on our living with it, will be essential for all of us.**

Casa Jasmina is a ground breaking lab for exactly these questions, and we're very grateful we got to experience it so early on. 

This publication kicks off an exploration of various aspects of the connected home as well as a large number of questions. It started out as a [series of blogposts](http://www.thewavingcat.com/tag/understandingtheconnectedhome/), but it became obvious early on that we would need to increase the scope sooner rather than later. So in a one week book sprint we aimed to lay the ground work for an ongoing research project. 

This collection of content - we consider it a 0.9 version of a book that is still in beta - will help us map out the terrain, and start conversations with future collaborators. It also serves as a pool of content (that is still under development, and will be so for a while to come), a word mine if you will.

We don't know yet where it will lead us, but we invite you to come along for the ride and join the conversation. 

We keep writing this in public on Gitbook, and license the content under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), so you can adapt and re-use the content, too. If you'd like to get more heavily involved, please get in touch.
