Please note: We are in the process of revising the book in preparation for version 2. Until this revision is done, the text online is going to look messy with many lose ends. The new version will be available here by early June; until then, please refer to [this archived version 1 (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4yp9delbrw9l0wu/20150911%20understanding-the-connected-home.pdf?dl=0).

# Intro

In May 2015, science fiction author Bruce Sterling gave a keynote at ThingsCon [^1]. In his talk [^2] he introduced a new project he had been working on with his partner Jasmina Tesanovic: Casa Jasmina [^3], the open source connected home of the future. It's a unique research project, an open source investigation of the connected home.

> It's time to live the life. Just go ahead and build the products and see if you can survive being in a room with them. This is our test bed.
-- Bruce Sterling at ThingsCon

A few weeks later, in June, we flew to Turin, Italy, along with Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino [^4] to visit this live-in lab Casa Jasmina and spend some time with the team. We were curious to see how it would be to live in and contribute to this home of the future. Casa Jasmina is a ground breaking lab for exactly these questions, and we're very grateful we got to experience it so early on. 

Ever since visiting [^5] Casa Jasmina, some questions that wouldn't leave us alone. There hasn't been a day where the topic of *connected homes* hadn't come up, where we haven't been trying to get closer to figuring out answers, or at least better questions. 

> How do we interact with a connected home? How does the space, and the things in it, communicate what's expected of the person who live there? What are the ground rules and who has permission to change them? What objects require interaction and what doesn't? How, in other word, do we know how to build and live in a connected home?

We asked a great number of smart and experienced people for their thoughts. It slowly emerged that it's an area that might just not be fully explored yet. An area that in fact we collectively have just begun to explore at all.

We know that connectivity increasingly makes its way into our living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms. Into our smoke detectors, lights, door locks, kitchen scales and ovens. We bring in more connectivity through fitness tracking wristbands and our phones and tablets, and take it along when we get into the driving computers that are our cars.

**Understanding the connected home - how it can be designed, how we can engage with it and turn it off, how we can live with it and still have control over our privacy - these questions will be essential for living in this century.**

Getting connected homes and their many facets right -  incl. interactions, privacy, empowerment - is a core challenge for designers, developers, entrepreneurs and policy makers for decades to come. 

**Connected homes will directly impact the lives of hundreds of millions - maybe billions - of people around the globe. We have to get this right.**

## Welcome to version 2

We published version 1 of [Understanding the Connected Home](http://theconnectedhome.org) a few months after our visit to Turin, in the fall of 2015. [^6] Turns out this collection of essays and thoughts about the implications of the ever-increasing connectedness of our homes could not have been more timely: Just about every major tech company has entered the field of connected homes with a smart home hub, a wifi-enabled light bulb, a thermostat or some other gadget. 

**We believe that understanding connected homes is even more timely and relevant now.**

While there has been great progress in terms of UX, manufacturing and technology, there has not been all that much reflection about the implication of the connected homes for our lives: How will ubiquitous connectedness and data change our domestic lives? And more importantly, how can we shape that change to be a net positive?

We wrote this book with practitioners in mind: The people who make the connected home happen. The "official" hats practitioners in this field wear include a wide range including designers, developers, strategists, entrepreneurs, researchers, activists, educators and many more. 

Our lense is that of experience, insight and soft influence - we are involved in many of the conversations in the field, but don't have to follow a strong commercial agenda. Instead, we understand ourselves as part of a professional peer-learning community. A globally distributed, diverse network of informal exchange driven by passion and collaborations that collectively evolves the conversation and state of the art.

## What's new in this version?

For us, the initial publication of this book has also been the starting point for a number of projects & conversations. Since then we have had plenty of opportunities to further our thinking and following up on some of the threads and questions we addressed before: 

- September 2015: In collaboration with Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino [^7], Peter launched The Good Home Project [^8] to explore the same set of questions this book addresses through design proposals
- January 2016: Michelle took on a new role at Mozilla Foundation as Director of the Open IoT Studio
- March 2016: Peter co-chaired Interaction16 [^9], a conference that gathered the global interaction design community in Helskinki where many questions of designing connected experiences, services and products were discussed indepth
- April 2016: The Good Home Project, with contributions from Iohanna Nicenboim [^10] and Michelle  exhibited at Fuori Salone in Milan
- April 2016: Michelle initiated a series of design sprints around privacy and the connected home starting with the Mozilla Open IoT Design Sprint Berlin in April 2016 [^11]
- April 2016: A research report and set of policy recommendations that Peter co-authored with Prof. Dr. Christoph Bieber for the German government on smart cities and their implications for citizens was published [^12]
- The whole time, ThingsCon spawned numerous local community events that explore the techniques, design and ethics of connected products and services.

It has, in other words, been a busy and productive year with countless touch points that are directly relevant to Understanding the Connected Home.

This also means it was time to revisit the essays. For this new and updated version of our book we revisited the old essays and updated, edited, cut ideas that seemed dated; we restructured a bit; and we added new chapters, especially around the meta level of frameworks and methods for exploring these ideas.

As always, we look forward to hearing about your thinking and hope to talk to you online or face-to-face.
