# Past

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

*In the past, human-to-machine interaction was modeled primarily on a single user interacting with a single machine. The lifespans of our built environment were long. And most use cases for the "home of the future" were about automation.* 

## Single user, single machine

The field of studying how humans interact with computers became established in the 1980s with the publication of *The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction*.[^1]  

The groundwork had been laid already in the 1960s by pioneering researchers such as Doug Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse.  

Engelbart and his team radically altered people's understanding of how humans could interact with computers. Surprisingly, they found in user tests that even though people had never seen or used a mouse before, they immediately caught on, making fewer mistakes and moving faster than when using other computers interfaces like the keyboard and a pointer pen.[^2] 

The team went on to invent a number of foundational interaction technologies, known somewhat affectionately today as "The Mother of All Demos."[^3]

If you watch Engelbart's demo (which you should, it's both brilliant and entertaining), you will note that he has to start pretty much with first principles:

**When introducing the mouse, Engelbart doesn't just introduce a new connected object. He also introduces a new paradigm of human-machine interaction.**

That means he doesn't just need to explain how the mouse works, but also needs to elaborate on:

- what the object is
- what it's for
- how it makes people's lives better 

For example, there's a long passage in the demo in which Engelbart describes typing up a shopping list. To do that, he also has to set up how and why you would sort and cluster the list, how you could copy & paste text, and why the mouse makes it easier to do so. 

That's a lot of explaining for just one small, novel device. 

Engelbart's demo shows us what it must be like for today's product designers making objects for the connected home. Not only do they have to describe what the object is and why its useful, they are also defining an entirely new field, with new layers of interaction and more complex systems than we've ever seen in our homes before. 


## Long lifespans

Human-to-machine interaction changes quite quickly. In recent years, we've seen major improvements to interfaces such as touch, voice and VR. Behind these innovations is the availability of ever-increasing computing power. 

Since the 1970s, computing power has doubled every two years, following a rate of growth known as Moore's Law.[^4]

However, while our computing environment moves at such a rapid rate, our built environment--that of our homes, places of work and leisure, our streets and urban infrastructure--have historically changed at a much slower rate.

Buildings can take years to construct and then stand for decades, if not centuries.  Renovating and retrofitting are important ways we maintain and repurpose our built environment. These are all relatively lengthy and costly processes, as compared to updating a digital service or even personal devices.   

With that in mind, we have to consider how these different timescales and lifespans intersect. Buildings and their infrastructure move at slower rates than computing. That means new digital services and connected objects must play with structures that may be hundreds of years old.

## Automation in the home 

A pioneer in human-machine interfaces and a solver of unusual problems, Doug Engelbart - inventor of the computer mouse, among other things - had a mantra: _augmentation not automation_. 

Engelbart's work focused on the human intellect and how to improve it. Yet, his [framework conceptual for augmenting the human intellect](http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) can guide our exploration of the connected home, too. 

He aimed to increase a human's capability to approach a complex problem situation, meaning "more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, **speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble.**" (emphasis ours)

Let's veer away from the human intellect and focus on the role of technology in general, and in the connected home in particular. Technology - and the various pieces of tech in the connected home - should aim to augment us as well, to help us be more human, more ourselves. It should offer us speedier, better solutions, and solve problems that previously seems insoluble.
