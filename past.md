human <> machine interaction was based on a single user interacting with a single machine.

Which brings us back to Doug Engelbart. One of his most famous moments is the first demo of the mouse: A groundbreaking, absolutely novel human-computer interface. ([The origin story of the mouse](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/mouse.html) makes for a great read.) 

That demo went down in the history books (in the interaction design history books at least) as [The Mother of All Demos (video playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL76DBC8D6718B8FD3&feature=plcp).

If you watch Engelbart's demo (which you should, it's both brilliant and entertaining), you will note that he has to start pretty much with first principles:

**When introducing the mouse, Engelbart doesn't just introduce a new computer peripheral. He also introduces a new paradigm of human-machine interaction.**

That means he doesn't just need to explain how the mouse works, but also needs to elaborate on...

- what it is
- what it is for (which problems it helps solve)
- how it makes its users' lives better (why is it worth engaging with)

There's a long passage in which Engelbart riffs on typing up a shopping list and sorting it, clustering items by category and shopping aisle, thanks to copy & paste as well as his handy new pointing device, the mouse. That's a lot of explaining for just one small device. Smart home device manufacturers beware!

**Introducing connectivity into our homes requires a lot of explanation:** What is being introduced, why is it worth it, what does it help us do better? What are the implications, use cases, and limits? **Why might it be worth fundamentally changing your notion of your own home for this new thing?**

This is a communications challenge on one hand. But more importantly it's a litmus test that designers and developers can apply to new ideas: Can the thing you are considering pass this filter? Will it be worth radically redefining what we mean traditionally mean by "home"?
