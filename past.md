# Past

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

*In the past, human-to-machine interaction was modeled primarily on a single user interacting with a single machine. The lifespans of our built environment was long. And many visions for the "home of the future" were about automation.* 

## Single user, single machine

The field of studying how humans interact with computers became established in the 1980s with the publication of *The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction*.[^1]  

The groundwork had been laid already in the 1960s by pioneering researchers such as Doug Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse.  

Engelbart and his team radically altered people's understanding of how humans could interact with computers. Surprisingly, they found in user tests that even though people had never seen or used a mouse before, they immediately caught on, making fewer mistakes and moving faster than when using other computers interfaces like the keyboard and a pointer pen.[^2] 

The team went on to invent a number of foundational interaction technologies, known somewhat affectionately today as "The Mother of All Demos."[^3]

If you watch Engelbart's demo (which you should, it's both brilliant and entertaining), you will note that he has to start pretty much with first principles:

**When introducing the mouse, Engelbart doesn't just introduce a new computer peripheral. He also introduces a new paradigm of human-machine interaction.**

That means he doesn't just need to explain how the mouse works, but also needs to elaborate on...

- what it is
- what it is for (which problems it helps solve)
- how it makes its users' lives better (why is it worth engaging with)

There's a long passage in which Engelbart riffs on typing up a shopping list and sorting it, clustering items by category and shopping aisle, thanks to copy & paste as well as his handy new pointing device, the mouse. That's a lot of explaining for just one small device. Smart home device manufacturers beware!


## Pioneering  

Which brings us back to Doug Engelbart. One of his most famous moments is the first demo of the mouse: A groundbreaking, absolutely novel human-computer interface. ([The origin story of the mouse](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/mouse.html) makes for a great read.) 

That demo went down in the history books (in the interaction design history books at least) as [The Mother of All Demos (video playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL76DBC8D6718B8FD3&feature=plcp).

**Introducing connectivity into our homes requires a lot of explanation:** What is being introduced, why is it worth it, what does it help us do better? What are the implications, use cases, and limits? **Why might it be worth fundamentally changing your notion of your own home for this new thing?**

This is a communications challenge on one hand. But more importantly it's a litmus test that designers and developers can apply to new ideas: Can the thing you are considering pass this filter? Will it be worth radically redefining what we mean traditionally mean by "home"?

## Different lifespans

* buildings vs. IoT devices (poses security risks) 

## Augmentation not automation

A pioneer in human-machine interfaces and a solver of unusual problems, Doug Engelbart - inventor of the computer mouse, among other things - had a mantra: _augmentation not automation_. 

Engelbart's work focused on the human intellect and how to improve it. Yet, his [framework conceptual for augmenting the human intellect](http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) can guide our exploration of the connected home, too. 

He aimed to increase a human's capability to approach a complex problem situation, meaning "more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, **speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble.**" (emphasis ours)

Let's veer away from the human intellect and focus on the role of technology in general, and in the connected home in particular. Technology - and the various pieces of tech in the connected home - should aim to augment us as well, to help us be more human, more ourselves. It should offer us speedier, better solutions, and solve problems that previously seems insoluble.
