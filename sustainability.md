# Sustainability

_Sustainable sourcing and manufacturing as well as designing for end-of-lifecycle aren't just important ecological and social considerations but also a great opportunity to position a connected home company better in the market place while saving their customers money._

Connected home products and infrastructure are computing infrastructure. As such, they tend to be  software-driven, and their lifecycles are linked to  innovation cycles of the processor industry.

In order to avoid that the connected home becomes a main contributor to the huge, fast-growing pile of hazardous electronics trash that has come out of the computer and smart phone industry over the last decade(s), we need to consider sustainability:

- Modularity in design can make it easier, cheaper, and more resource friendly to replace broken parts and those that need upgrades.
- Open source, compliance to standards, and APIs can help connected products to be able to do their job longer, for example when a mobile operating system emerges or falls out of fashion.
- Better, more ecologically and socially conscious sourcing of material and manufacturing can help reduce the footprint of a product.[^1]
- Recycling and end-of-lifecycle should be considerations through the design and manufacturing process as well as ongoing user communications.[^2]

Makers of connected home products need to make sustainability a priority both from an ecological and social perspective (our planet and society can only handle so much more abuse) and because it makes sense for their customers (sustainability can lead to substantial savings in the medium and long term). 

We believe that companies strongly embracing sustainability ulimately put themselves in a better position in the market.[^3]

As a prominent example of a B Corporation that seems particularly relevant in terms of sustainable, fair production as well as recycling and end-of-lifecycle look no further than Patagonia ([PDF: Patagonia's B Corp Annual report 2014](http://www.patagonia.com/pdf/en_US/bcorp_annual_report_2014.pdf)).
