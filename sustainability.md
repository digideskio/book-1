# Sustainability

_Sustainable sourcing and manufacturing as well as designing for end-of-lifecycle are responsible and necessary. They are also market opportunities._

## DONE

Connected home products and infrastructure are computing infrastructure. As such, they tend to be software-driven, and their lifecycles are linked to the innovation cycles of the processor industry.

To avoid connected homes becoming the next main contributor to hazardous e-waste piles, we need to consider sustainability:

- Modularity in design can make it easier, cheaper, and more resource-friendly to replace broken parts and those that need upgrades.
- Open source, compliance to standards, and APIs can help connected products to do their job longer, for example when a  mobile operating system emerges or falls out of fashion.
- Better, more ecologically and socially conscious sourcing of material and manufacturing can help reduce the footprint of a product.[^1]
- Recycling and end-of-lifecycle should be considerations through the design and manufacturing process as well as ongoing user communications.[^2]

Makers of connected home products need to make sustainability a priority. 

We believe that companies strongly embracing sustainability ulimately put themselves in a better position in the market[^3]--both from an ecological and social perspective (our planet and society can only handle so much more abuse) and because it makes sense for their customers (sustainability can lead to substantial savings in the medium and long term).
