# The home as a user agent

There are likely three kinds of interactions in a connected home: 

* user-to-user
* user-to-machine
* machine-to-machine

Each of these interactions will require protocols and conflict resolution, as well as **layers of interpretation** that help each other understand what's going on and how to interact with it. 

Borrowing from the **[three-tiered Creative Commons licensing structure](https://creativecommons.org/licenses)**, we'd like to explore a framework that is: 

* human-readable
* machine-readable
* environment-readable

and then explore how this framework could position **the home as a trusted agent that advocates for and protects its user(s).** 

## Human-readable

## Machine-readable

## Environment-readable
 
[moved to Concepts > Interactions > New Layers]

## Key takeaways

To facilitate interactions among users, machines and their connected environments, we need different layers that can be read and modified by those actors. We can adapt a model pioneered by Creative Commons to define these layers. The newest layer, environment-readable, is still greatly undefined, but it could be imagined as an important advocate for the user, similar to a modern web browser.
