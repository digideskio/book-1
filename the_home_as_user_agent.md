# The home as a user agent

There are likely three kinds of interactions in a connected home: 

* user-to-user
* user-to-machine
* machine-to-machine

Each of these interactions will require protocols and conflict resolution, as well as **layers of interpretation** that help each other understand what's going on and how to interact with it. 

Borrowing from the **[three-tiered Creative Commons licensing structure](https://creativecommons.org/licenses)**, we'd like to explore a framework that is: 

* human-readable
* machine-readable
* home-readable

and then explore how this framework could position **the home as a trusted agent that advocates for and protects its user(s).** 

## Human-readable

This layer is about the **humans in the home being able to read and understand what's going on**. As much as possible, this layer should convey things in very simple iconography or text. 

The goal is that the users, **regardless of their technical proficiency**, will feel confident in understanding what the object or service is offering, how it proposes to interact with other humans and objects, and any other important information.  

There may be ways in which the other layers will **guide and advise the user**. This could be preventing malicious software from being installed, or conveying to other devices and the outside world that the user does not want to be track. 

**At the human-readable layer, the user should be able to understand that the actions taken on their behalf, and they should have the ability to modify or opt-out of those actions if they choose.**  

In other words, wherever possible, this should not only be a read-only layer, but also one that the inhabitants in the home **can write and execute.** By being conveyed in a simple manner that is understandable to them, yet while offering the ability to modify it to suit their needs, the user gains greater control in their own dwelling. 

This control is essential for people **to live confidently and with dignity** in their home. 

## Machine-readable

Naturally, as connected devices enter the home, they will want to talk to each other. That means there will need to be a layer of interaction that is for machines to read. 

There is a lot of work to be done designing this layer as well. Through decades of developing network technology, there are  conventions that have been established in terms of interoperability and naming. There are ways to structure data so that machines can read it effectively. 

This layer can be incredibly powerful when set up correctly and in a way that will both honor what the user wants and that cooperates well with other devices, datasets and systems. 

## Home-readable
 
The question now is that if you fill an environment with humans and connected objects, is there a system or server that helps to manage and support everything? If so, what does that system need to act as a good advocate for the user? If and what layers should be built so that the users' interests are enacted, much like the web browser does today when surfing online? 

The home layer (or more generically environment layer) will have to parse what interactions are happening among machines, what the user has indicated as preferences, and perhaps also do some pro-active protection or advocacy on the users' behalf. That could be blocking malicious software or telling devices not to track the home's inhabitants, if they've asked not to be. 

This layer seems the most ambigious at the moment, but it's potentially very important to get right. 

## Key takeaways

To facilitate interactions among users, machines and their connected environments, we need different layers that can be read and modified by those actors. We can adapt a model pioneered by Creative Commons to define these layers. The newest layer, home-readable, is still greatly undefined, but it could be imagine as an advocate for the home's user, similar to a modern web browser.
