> On the whole, you find wealth much more in use than in ownership. â€” Aristotle[^1]

Living together means sharing objects. Under which circumstances we feel it's ok to share what differs: Different rules of sharing apply in families, partnerships, among roommates.

Be it the TV remote, a book, the dining room table, or the dishes, the home is filled with objects that might be used by multiple people - sometimes simultaneously, sometimes asynchronously, sometimes even without the owner's permission.[^2]

Once they are connected, the rules and implications of sharing change yet again:

- Through personalization and modularity, we can design and prepare for fuller shared usage: By switching accounts (hopefully without requiring us to enter long unwieldy passwords) the software layer can adapt the object to our preferences. Think of the connected lamp/thermosthat/oven equivalent of a game console. 
- Trust management can help to better navigate who can use what object. 
- Learning algorithms can start to mold objects to each of their users. The collected data can be used to improve the service that object renders both for the individual user and for the overall group of users. Increasingly it might even make sense to contribute usage data of some sort or another by sharing aggregate data back to the larger public, the data commons.

Connected object collect the data equivalent of a patina from use, they get better through use, gain value and deliver better services the more they are used. This in turn might evenlead to a more sustainable appreciation of shared physical goods.

 
### Rival vs. non-rival goods

**Connectedness might be a path towards turning physical goods from a rivaling into a non-rivaling (or at least _less rivaling_) way.**

Historically, **physical objects are "rival goods."** That means if one person has it, no one else can have it. For example, I'm reading a paperback book, and unless you're comfortable reading over someone's shoulder, it's not possible for you to read the book at the same time. 

However, **digital things are often "non-rival goods."** That means if I'm reading a digital copy of this book, you can also have a copy on your device that you're reading at the same time. 

**When we add connectivity to an object, could we start to use physical resources in a non-rival way?**


What characteristics defines connected objects? When we imagine objects being shared, what if we consider usage beyond the household - neighbors, friends, the broader world? What if an object could even be used by several of these group at the same time?

How can we build and use objects in the connected home so that others can use them as well? Is there a way to build shared resources in the connected home, for example through pooling and sharing computational capacity when we don't need all of our processors' full capacity?


There are many questions to further explore here. The early days of collaborative consumption and the sharing economy can provide some useful pointers in the right direction. [^3] Some of the key concerns we see:

- Trust management: If we have pseudo-non-rival goods being shared thanks to their connectivity, how do we facilitate trust among users?
- Modularity: Because shared connected objects will get a lot of usage (hopefully), they should be built to be easily maintained and repaired. [^4]
- Value add through usage: How do we design connected objects to improve, rather than degrade, through use? Algorithmic learning seems to offer promising avenues to explore.
- Privacy: In connected objects, multiple users means that we need to firewall against data leaks between users. If user or aggregate data is to be shared back into larger services or the commons, that data needs to be squeeky clean [^5] to make sure it cannot be linked back to individual users even if analyzed in a big data scenario.
- Decision-making and resource coordination: Do we need technological or design solutions to make decision-making and allocation of shared resources easier, or is that a social challenge in need of a social solution? Can a connected object be designed to facilitate this resource coordination? [^6]

Shared connected objects offer a great opportunity for designers and technologists to explore. There is a wide range of tricky issues and questions to figure out and dig into. 



[^1]: Supposedly. Citation needed. Sounds great, though, doesn't it? Kidding. [Property and Ownership](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/property/) by Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a fantastic resource around the philosophy of ownership.
[^2]: If it is even clear who the owner is. As anyone  living in a long-term relationship or family will confirm, the lines of ownership tend to blur over time. If anything, we expect this effect to grow stronger as learning objects will start to mold to their users over time, potentially making even the question of ownership in this kind of setting pointless.

[^4]: The [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/) is a great example of a device that uses modular design to enable repair and upgrades without having to toss out the whole thing. We should foster this kind of modular design, as it will help make more sustainable objects as well as objects that are more shareable.
[^5]: Totally a technical term. 
[^6]: With his [Addicted Toasters](http://addictedproducts.com) project, creative technologist [Simone Rebaudengo](http://simonerebaudengo.com) explored this in a playful way: When his connected toasters felt under-utilized, they tweeted publicly to find a new owner who would use them more frequently.
