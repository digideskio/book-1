# Tenant(s) and landlord

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

A look at moving (factory reset), maintaining a home (home sweet) and buying a home. 

## Moving in
Let's consider for a moment that a home full of sensors and network infrastructure is basically a computer we live in. 

That means we need to consider implications of security and control, [as Cory Doctorow does here](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/07/features/stop-spies). It also means we need to think about technical failure and personal data.

Most failure situations in a connected home are likely to be variations of: 

* [Users not understanding their home's infrastructure](http://www.thewavingcat.com/2015/08/03/understanding-the-connected-home-ground-rules/), or 
* [Things clashing with things](http://www.thewavingcat.com/2015/08/17/understanding-the-connected-home-managing-conflict/)


### Computers crash

Those siutations are dire enough. But what happens in case of a more fundamental crash? What does the [blue screen of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death) look like for a home?

Can you reboot your apartment? How? Have you tried turning it off and on again?

#### What happens when you move out of your home?

As we steep our networked homes in personal data, as our kitchen clouds and algorithmic assistants learn about our behaviors and preferences, we imprint ourselves on our living spaces not just physically as we have done traditionally, but also digitally, through data.

And much like (depending on which country you're in) we tend to renovate and paint the walls either upon moving in or moving out - in other words: resetting the apartment - we'll want to do the same on the data & algorithm level. Just like we don't want to leave any smudges or holes on a wall after living at a place, we don't want to hand over a house with our data still inside it.

#### Factory Reset

So how does a factory reset work? Does it wipe all data completely? Are there pathways in the neural network that power our future homes that cannot be fully wiped, just like really old houses have grooves in their wooden floors from generations of people walking the same beeline from bedroom to bathroom? 

When we arrive at the next place, do we start from scratch or do we transfer everything over to the new place? What if the location change is only part of what's new, say if a couple split up and the old place's data sets were generated by two people and the new place is for someone freshly single - or the other way round? Will data from a bachelor pad seep into the new shared couple's space like some old Bob Marley poster and be greeted by the other data set with a similar kind of resentment as its physical counterpart? When children grow up and leave the home to university or their first job, do they take their childhood data with them? Or does it get boxed up and stored as mementos, to be recalled and possibly discarded at a later date?

## Key takeaways

- We need to figure out how we handle data residue when moving.
- What do failure modes in connected homes look like? Is there an off switch?
- How do we merge "home data" when moving together, or divide it up upon moving out?
