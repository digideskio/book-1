A few weeks later, in June 2015, we flew to Turin, Italy, to visit a unique research project: Casa Jasmina[^1], the connected home of the future, an open source investigation of the connected home by Bruce Sterling and Jasmina Tesanovic as well as the Arduino team, represented by Lorenzo Romagnoli and Massimo Banzi. It's a home that its visitors equip with connectivity over time: A live-in lab that lets us live in the future for a few days, and see what works and what needs fixing.






Ever since [visiting Casa Jasmina](http://www.thewavingcat.com/2015/07/22/visiting-casa-jasmina/) one question we discussed there wouldn't leave me alone - there literally hasn't been a day where the topic hasn't come up, where we haven't been trying to get closer to figuring out answers, or at least better questions: How do we interact with a connected home? How does the space, and the things in it, communicate what's expected of the person, what the ground rules are, what requires interaction and what doesn't? How, in other word, do we know how connected a home is, and in which way?

Over the weekend at Foocamp, I (Peter) asked many people for their thoughts on the topic, all of whom are smarter than me and many of whom have a great deal of experience in related matters. From interaction design to artificial intelligence researcher to chip engineer to journalist: Both in a session I hosted about the topic and in many hallway conversations it slowly emerged that it's an area that might just not be fully explored yet. 



And yet, we know that connectivity increasingly makes its way into our living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms. Into our smoke detectors, lights, door locks, kitchen scales and ovens. We bring in more connectivity through fitness tracking wristbands and our phones and tablets, and take it along when we get into the driving computers that are our cars.

**Understanding the connected home and the decisions that go into designing it, as well as its impact on our living with it, will be essential for all of us.**

Casa Jasmina, the open source connected home of the future that the Arduino crew is exploring with Jasmina Tesanovic and Bruce Sterling is a ground breaking lab for exactly these questions, and we're very grateful we got to experience it so early on.

Starting with this blog post, we'll explore various aspects of the connected home as well as a large number of questions in a new series.
