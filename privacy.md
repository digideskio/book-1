# Privacy

## WRITTEN: P
## PROOFED?

_We consider privacy a core value to be considered throughout the design, manufacture, usage and end of a connected product or service._

Our home needs to be a safe space: *What happens at home needs to stay at home.* Data driven services put this safe space in serious danger, so we must build safeguards.

Specifically, that means building in safeguards like: 

- strong privacy default settings
- requiring clear and unambiguous consent from users
- plans for data breaches
- strict transparency rules
- options to delete data, and data portability

These will have to be backed by legal responsibility and accountability for the enabling industries like data service providers and technology companies. (As many connected home solutions are proposed by startups, it is especially important to also ensure that startups play by the same rules.)


**Privacy by design**
Connected home systems should be private by design. [^1] Concretely, this means following ground rules like:

- Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial
- Privacy as the default setting
- Privacy embedded into design
- Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum
- End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection
- Visibility and transparency – keep it open
- Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric


**Consent**
Valid consent must be explicit for data collected and purposes data used. Consent must be verifiable. Data controllers must be able to prove "consent" (opt-in) and consent may be withdrawn at any time. 

This is necessary. It is also a good practice that will ensure that users can trust services - so far, user acceptance of smart home products has been limited to say the least.


**Data breaches**
In case a data breach occurs, there's already strong regulation in place, especially in Europe: [^2]

> Legal obligation to notify the Supervisory Authority without undue delay and this is also still subject to negotiations at present. The reporting of a data breach is not subject to any de minimis standard and it is likely that the GDPR will provide that such breaches must be reported to the Supervisory Authority as soon as they become aware of the data breach (Article 31). Individuals have to be notified if adverse impact is determined.

The best companies will go way beyond the legal minimum and proactively seek out users and propose actionable steps to remedy the situation.

**Data deletion** 
Users should always be able to delete their data. Again, the regulation in Europe is already in place:

The data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to him on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.

How this will workable within the context of aggregated data, big data sets, and shared data will have to be seen.

In addition to data deletion, to give users control over their data and how it is used all connected home services should be built with data portability in mind. How to implement this is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, but users should at all times be able to move their personal data into and out a service - this means easy-to-access export functionality as much as strict adoption of standards.
