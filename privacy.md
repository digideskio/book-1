# Privacy

## DONE

_Privacy is a core value, especially in the unique setting of a home. Safeguards such as informed user consent and data deletion can improve privacy, and companies should be held accountable to deliver these practical measures._

Our home needs to be a safe space. It must be respectful of its  inhabitants, especially when it comes to sensitive information and personal data. As the home becomes more connected, data-driven services can put this safe space at risk. 

Therefore, we must build safeguards such as:

- strong privacy default settings
- requiring clear and unambiguous consent from users
- contingency plans for data breaches
- strict transparency rules
- options to delete data 
- and the ability to port data to other services

These safeguards will have to be backed with legal muscle and regulatory accountability for data service providers and technology companies. 

Importantly, since many start-ups are creating connected home products, it is especially important to ensure these volatile companies adhere to these safeguards as well. 

## Privacy by design

Connected home systems should be private by design[^1] by following measures such as:

- Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial
- Privacy as the default setting
- Privacy embedded into design
- Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum
- End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection
- Visibility and transparency – keep it open
- Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric
- The best way of protecting data is to not collect it in the first place

## Consent

Best practices around consent help build users' trust in connected products. So far, user acceptance of smart home products has been limited, to say the least. 

To foster trust, makers of connected products can ensure valid consent is explicit for collecting as well as its usage. This consent must be verifiable. Data controllers must be able to prove "consent" (opt-in), and consent may be withdrawn at any time. 

## Data breaches

Data breaches are a fact of digital life. 

In Europe, there's already regulation in place to determine what happens in a breach.[^2] It must be reported to a supervisory authority, and individuals have to be notified if adverse impact is determined.

The best companies will go way beyond the legal minimum and proactively seek out users and propose actionable steps to remedy the situation.

## Data deletion

Furthermore, users should always be able to delete their data. Again, the regulation in Europe is already in place. 

> The data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to him on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness)...where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.

Of course, how deletion works with aggregated data and big data sets is tricky. Nevertheless, these frameworks show how values around a user's control of their personal data can be articulated and advocated.

## Data portability

In addition to data deletion, users should be able to move their data across connected home services. Portability should be guaranteed even as a user moves across different companies' products. 

As an innovation opportunity, connected products can offer easy data import and export functions as well as adopt standards that build in portability.
