# Where from here

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?


This book kicks off what we hope will be an **on-going research project** about the connected home. 

This book opened a lot of lines of inquiry. Some we may see answers to in a short while. Others might be **laughable in a decade from now** when many of these technologies will have settled in and **become quotidian**. 

That's the fun of writing something like this. 

Over the coming years, we anticipate many ways to continue these reflections. Be it organizing events like **ThingsCon** and **Mozfest**, to **facilitating workshops** and **designing curriculum**, to **further writing and prototyping**, we're excited to make and learn with a growing community of people interested in the connected home. 

As for yourself, what aspects of the connected home interest you the most? **Where do you see the biggest challenges?** In what ways do you **see yourself and your loved ones** engaging with and learning about these future living spaces? **What could you be doing today** that prepares for building and understanding a more humane, connected home?
