This book kicks off what we hope will be an **ongoing reflection and research project** about the connected home. 

From organizing events like **ThingsCon** and **Mozfest**, to **facilitating workshops** and **designing curriculum**, to **further writing and prototyping**, wemany ways to continue these efforts.
