# Concepts

Interactions in the connected home happen at two layers: human-readable and machine-readable. By "readable" we mean a human or machine can easily understand, modify and execute actions.

To engage in the human-readable layer, we may need to learn certain skills and competencies so that we can be empowered in connected environments and able to read, write and participate fully in them.

For machine-readable interactions, connected objects are equipped with the technical ability to sense, think, and act. We see different categories of connected objects appearing in the home. 

The human-readable and machine-readable layers require mediation. That means we'll need tools and protocols that translate between humans and machines, as well as mechanisms to negotiate and resolve conflicts in and between these systems.

Looking at one area of conflict more closely, we see how controlling personal data is complex, contextual, cultural, and fuzzy. We need to develop both human-readable tools, such as vocabulary and metaphors, as well as machine-readable ones, like metadata, so that humans can control their privacy across these layers of interaction.
