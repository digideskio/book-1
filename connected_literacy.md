# Connected literacy 

The web is where our personal, civic, and economic lives connect. Knowing how to wield the web is essential to success today. Tomorrow, we will need web literacy for connected environments. To understand how this might be tackled, let's consider how web literacy works and than apply this model to the connected home.

## Why web literacy

There are 2.3 billion internet users today, and another billion coming online soon. It is critical that everyone knows how to read, write and participate in the digital world. 

What skills and competencies needed to wield the web in this way? 

Through an open consultation stewarded by the Mozilla Foundation, a group of educational and technology stakeholders created the [Web Literacy Map](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/web-literacy/).

The goal of defining and teaching web literacy is to help people become critical consumers, contributors and participants on the Web. If people experience the web as critical to their learning, work and social lives they will better understand their role in helping the Web remain open, accessible and a resource for all. 

## What does web literacy cover?

The Web Literacy Map is an agreed ‘map of the territory’ from which to build resources and curricula to teach the web. This is a descriptive rather than prescriptive map. That is to say people and organizations can align with it no matter what context they are working in - and no matter what level they are working at. 

The whitepaper ["Why Mozilla cares about Web Literacy"](https://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/) explains:  

> Other candidate terms such as ‘digital literacy’ and ‘information literacy’ seem too wide-ranging and ambiguous to adequately cover the web. Possible alternatives such as ‘media literacy’ and ‘computational thinking’ certainly overlap with web literacy, but there is something sufficiently unique about ‘web literacy’ to be worth of attention.

Notably, web literacy is not just about "learning to code." In addition to covering code and scripting, the map also highlights competencies such as collaborating, privacy, navigation, design & accesibility, and more. 

When the first versions of Web Literacy Map were published, it was acknowledged that it will evolve and mature along with the web itself.

For example, there are also discussions about how to include ["21st Century Skills"](http://www.imls.gov/about/21st_century_skills_list.aspx) in our understanding of web literacy today. Amongst these skills are critical thinking and problem solving, scientific and numerical literacy, global awareness, environmental literacy, flexibility and adaptability, as well as financial and entrepreneurial literacy. 

## Web literacy in connected environments

Now with the rise of connected environments, with objects tapping into or building on top of the web and the increasing need for 21st Century skills, we should investigate how web literacy can be interpreted here. 

### Reading the connected home

The "reading" strand of web literacy is about navigation, web mechanics, search, credibility and security. 

In a connected environment, it will be important to recognize common visual cues in these services. Maybe those are standardized symbols on the objects in your home that explain what's happening to your data, or how to turn them on and off. 

You will want to read, evalute and manipulate the data in your home. This also means knowing the role algorithms play in creating and managing content, and even creating and modifying those algorithms to suit your needs. 

Search will take on different nuances in the connected home. How will you find real-time or time-sensitive information about your home? How will you discover information and resources to help you navigate your home, to fix things and solve problems effectively?

No doubt you'll have to compare and contrast information from a number of sources. Maybe your smart thermostat gives you one reading while your connected windows tell you another. How will you read that information and make informed judgments? 

How will you know which manufacturers or service providers to trust? How will you identify that information and investigate those sources further? 

What are the ways to protect yourself from scams and phishing in your connected home? Where will you manage your accounts and logins securely, not to mention knowing how to encrypt your objects properly? 

How will you be able to access your objects preferences and settings to ensure you have the level of security you desire?

### Writing the connected home

The "writing" strand of web literacy is about composing, remixing, designing, coding/scripting, and accessibility. 

How will you identify content and data that you can modify? What will be the techniques and conditions needed to combine this data to create something new? How will you properly cite and reference original content or other data sets and services? 

What options will you have to change the style and layout of your connected environment? What mechanisms can you use to improve your user experience through feedback and iteration? What will you be able to make and generate that can be used in an enviroment-agnostic way, say for example when you move between homes or into other settings? 

In the connected home, APIs will be quite important. How will you query them and how will you build on top of them? How will you learn about and apply scripting frameworks effectively? 

There will also be reprecussions in design. How will you evaluate different interfaces and understand what will best suit you or others you are caring for? How do you improve accessibility for your loved ones through the usage and maintance of your home?  
     

### Participating in the connected home

The "participating" strand of web literacy is about sharing, collaborating, participation, privacy and open practices.

In your home, how will you create and use a system to distribute content to others? How can you contribute to and find content for the benefit of others? What techniques will we use to elicit peer feedback, as well as understand our desired audiences to make relevant contributions ourselves? Importantly, how will you identify when it is safe to contribute content?

Collaboration in your home is also interesting. This could be doing a chore together, or doing something together for entertainment, etc. How will you choose what platforms and tools to use for the particular collaboration at hand? How will you co-create? 

What will be the notifications that you'll configure to keep up-to-date with your collaborators, or with the communities you care about? How will you develop and articulare shared expectations and outcomes? Or work towards a shared goal using synchronous and asynchronous tools?

These skills tie directly in with privacy as well, including knowing how to advocate for privacy as a value and a right in the networked world. 

To be literate in connected spaces, you'll want to explain the ways in which unsolicited third parties can track you across devices and environments. How will you control metadata shared online, or identify the rights retained and removed in user agreements? Also, there will definitely be a need to manage online identities. 

Perhaps essential in all of these skills in an understanding of how and why to advocate for healthy ecosystems and things that work for you, on your terms.

## Key takeaways

Mozilla's Web Literacy Map is a useful framing for what one needs to read, write and participate with the web. We can apply the map to better understand what products, resources and curricula are needed for users to feel empowered in their connected homes.
