# Security

_Users and their data need to be protected from any party that might try to track, spy, or hack. Aggregate data needs to be anonymized in a way that guarantees that data cannot be traced back to identifiable users._

## DONE

Computer systems are notoriously easy to attack once they are connected to the internet. The connected home is no different. 

Historically, because of the relatively low distribution of smart home devices, security was a bit of a secondary concern.

Recently, with more and more reports of hacked internet-enabled baby phones, CCTV cameras and fridges turned into email spamming machines[^1], security became more of a priority both in the products' design process and communications.

We believe that tight security is absolutely essential. Users and their data need to be protected from any party that might try to track, spy, or hack--be it criminals, commercial entities or governments.[^2] 

Only then the home can be the safe space that is must be. 

Aggregate data needs to be anonymized in a way that really guarantees that data cannot be traced back to identifiable users. This includes when data sets are combined with other sets, or in future big data scenarios.

Wherever possible, data should not be saved at all. The best way to prevent abuse of data is not to have it in the first place.
