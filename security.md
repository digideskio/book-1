# Security

_Users and their data need to be protected from any party that might try to track, spy, or hack. Aggregate data needs to be anonymized in a way that guarantees that data cannot be traced back to identifiable users._

Computer systems are notoriously easy to attack once they are connected to the internet. The connected home is no different. 

Historically, because of the relatively low distribution of smart home devices, security was a bit of a secondary concern: Better security just wasn't assumed to sell more units. Recently, with more and more reports of hacked internet-enabled baby phones, CCTV cameras and fridges turned into email spamming machines [^1], security becomes more of a priority both in the products' design process and communications.

We believe that tight security is absolutely essential. Users and their data need to be protected from any party that might try to track, spy, or hack, be it criminals, commercial entities or governments.[^2] Only then the home can be the safe space that is must be. 

Security also means ensuring that even aggregate data is anonymized in a way that really guarantees that data cannot be traced back to identifiable users - not even when data sets are combined with others, or in future big data scenarios.
