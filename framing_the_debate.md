# Framing the debate

As connectivity is increasingly seeping into our homes, we need to ask ourselves: What's a smart home? What is it today and what's the vision for a potential tomorrow? In which ways will the connected home manifest itself?

## Low-hanging fruit: Automation & Personalization

Currently, two fields get most attention in the smart home debate: Automation and personalization. 

Automation includes things like learning thermostats and remote-controlling locks and lights.

Personalization includes bringing your personal preferences to the space, like through pre-set mood lighting, or bringing your own media and playlists.

It seems to us that both are very much low-hanging fruit. The comparatively easy availability of these fields, plus the fact that they are well-established mental models that require basically no change on the users' side make these the basic go-to scenarios. They are also, we think, somewhat boring and just an interstitial step.

But an interstitial step _to where_? That's hard to predict, and figuring that out is part of this whole excercise.
