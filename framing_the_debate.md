# Framing the debate

As connectivity is increasingly seeping into our homes, we need to ask ourselves: What's a smart home? What is it today and what's the vision for a potential tomorrow? In which ways will the connected home manifest itself?

## Low-hanging fruit: Automation & Personalization

Currently, two fields get most attention in the smart home debate: Automation and personalization. 

Automation includes things like learning thermostats and remote-controlling locks and lights.

Personalization includes bringing your personal preferences to the space, like through pre-set mood lighting, or bringing your own media and playlists.

It seems to us that both are very much low-hanging fruit. The comparatively easy availability of these fields, plus the fact that they are well-established mental models that require basically no change on the users' side make these the basic go-to scenarios. They are also, we think, somewhat boring and just an interstitial step.

But an interstitial step _to where_? That's hard to predict, and figuring that out is part of this whole excercise.

## Vectors

As of today, we're working under the assumption that it will take another 10 years or so for most homes to cross some kind of "connectedness threshold" - with the notable exception (and we're painting in broad strokes here) of Asia's mega cities, where often large-scale network infrastructure is dropped right into the new buildings to a much higher degree than in many Western cities, where retro-fitting is a bigger thing.

The way we will get used to the technologies, and where we will thus also develop the social norms around these kind of new interactions, is most likely through **the vectors of retail spaces, office buildings, and hotels**: Interstitial, transactional contexts where we engage much more openly with infrastructure due to the temporary nature of the interaction. Places where we are more accepting of privacy-diminishing interactions if they either come with a net gain or if they seem, frankly, simply unavoidable. Then, over time, these things will find their ways into our homes.
