# My personal data sphere

## [moved some content to Scenarios > host/guest and Scenarios > tenant/landlord. some content to Principles. some to Concepts > Mediating]

Through our smartphones, we have instant access to all our data. A personal cloud of data that travels with us. 

But even though we know that (meta-)data about us and our whereabouts is constantly sent back to various entities - tech & advertising companies, government agencies, telcos - context-triggered data exchanges beyond the most basic level are still relatively rare. Despite all the efforts of Google Now, Siri, Cortana & co, most of the time we need to actively seek out the data/app/info we are looking for. That's not a bad thing in and of itself, but it might change for the connected home.

## Bringing data & preferences along

Lots of current scenarios for smart buildings advertise personalization and adapting to personal preferences, particularly in regards to climate control (temperature, humidity), lighting (colors, brightness), settings (music, mood lighting, window blinds). 

This is legit, and in fact might play an important role - for example, [Philips research suggests](http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/news/press/2015/20150318-philips-calls-for-a-rethink-of-office-lighting-to-meet-the-needs-of-an-ageing-workforce.wpd) that older workforce requires much brighter light than younger workforce, and that the brightness of light at the workplace has serious impact on well-being.

So upon entering your home, or room (in shared living arrangements), or hotel room/rental apartment (in temporary/travel housing), it would make sense to communicate your preferences to the building so it can adapt accordingly. 

**We are surrounded by a sphere of personal data that moves through time and space with us, and it might linger here and there.**

**Currently, we don't have a universal mechanism to communicate our preferences to a building.** Of course, many home automation companies are working on just that, at varying degrees of standardization. 

**What are the next steps here, what's the big vision?** What kind of data might be interesting to bring into a home, to take out of a home, to take along to a new place? What kind of data might we want to bring along into connected cars? What do we want to share with the smart city in all its manifestations? **These are big research questions.**

**How do we transmit personal data to our environment?** What are the models to transfer all these types of data (preferences, settings, etc.)? Should this happen through the cloud? Through apps and our phones? Should we carry one piece of digital ID (built into the phone or wearables) that just serves as an identifier to then download our things from the internet, or should it all be stored locally? **What do the interaction models look like?**

## Our homes need to honor our needs and rights

## Ethics are implemented at the design level

[moved to Principles]

## Negotiating agreements

## Key takeaways

- We increasingly are surrounded by a sphere of personal data.
- Our homes need to honor our rights and needs.
- This protection needs to be implemented at the design and regulatory levels.
- We need to develop mechanisms to negotiate our agreements to various types of data-based interactions.
- Rules and types of data-based interactions need to be human and machine readable.
