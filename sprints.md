# Sprints

_Content sprints are a great way to do a first quick collaborative deep-dive into a topic as complex as connected homes._

Content sprints—sometimes also referred to as topic or book sprints—are heavily condensed writing exercises with a focus on collaboration and peer review: A group comes together and within a few days or weeks writes a chunk of content to be published by the end of the sprint.

This very book was started as a content sprint back in 2015, and updated in another in 2016.

We believe that this is a great way to explore a new topic: While you will never get as deep into the subject matter as with longer term academic research or the deep immersion that comes with writing a book for a traditional publisher, great insights can be gained with this faster format.

The trick is to get the framing and team right: Get experts from different backgrounds together and frame the questions so they can be chunked into discreet pieces of writing: One idea per chapter. Combine this with a strong bias towards practitioners and experience and the sprint can be a very rewarding format indeed.

Think of it as a blended learning technique that’s part workshop, part collaborative writing exercise, part shared learning experience. Combined with a strong bias towards “shipping”—a term from the software development word meaning output, or just “getting stuff out the door”—topic sprints favor publishing over planning, producing copy over drafting outlines, peer review over control through external established publishers.[^1]

We have been involved in a number of similar sprints, from super quick 1-day mini-reports to large groups writing a full book over the course of a week. (With two authors and several weeks time in total, this book sits somewhere in the middle.)

If you plan to explore the connected home, we recommend you consider a content sprint.

Sprints have strengths and weaknesses. They can be great tools, but aren’t fit for every context as they are built on principles that favor certain types of outcomes over others. Within this framework, it’s relatively easy to fine-tune the process to match various needs.

These unshakable pillars of the sprint are: [^2]

- A bias towards shipping. “Done is better than perfect,” as the saying goes. By the end of the sprint, the result is going to be published, no matter what. (Or handed over to a copy editor for final polishing, if that’s more your thing—but no more work should happen on the core content.)
- Strong focus on collaboration. This is a team exercise that lives on collaboration, sharing, and open exchange. Where there is too much ego at play, a sprint will not fulfill its full potential.
Credit where credit is due. In a highly collaborative environment it is hard to give credit for any given word, sentence or paragraph. However, everyone working on the sprint or any of its chapters should be visibly credited.
- Peer review. No matter who’s the leading expert of the group for any given topic, chances are that others can add value and refine, both in substance and in style. Peer review and co-editing are at the very heart of the sprint process.

We would love to see more writing on these issues. If this sounds like it might work for you, we urge you do try out a topic sprint.
