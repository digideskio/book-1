# How do things communicate their expectations?

The connected home can be a mysterious, opaque place: Unless we already happen to know the connected devices ("Oh look, a Nest thermostat!") we can't tell what's going on.

**The connected home is not yet human-readable.** 

How do we know what's expected of us as users, residents, visitors? 

There are three aspects to this:

1. How can devices or (increasingly "invisible") services communicate what they require their users to do without being obnoxious?

2. How do we convey to the room what we expect of it? 

3. How does this change depending on which role we are currently in (residents v guests v temporary renters)?

The first aspect might be tackled through increased labeling to make the situation more human-readable: A set of icons to indicate active engagement v passive sensing, for example. This is not very elegant and a stop-gap measure at best. On the machine-readable side of things this might work ok, if we can find standards that make all smart things compatible reliably. From today's point of view, that's still some way off.

Does it share data to the cloud?" Some possible connected device engagement icons.

The second aspect is one that right now seems hard to solve from a technological angle if it should happen smoothly in the background. We might just need to explicitly state our needs/wishes: "Ok Google!"

The third aspect requires more nuance and context awareness. Recent advances in algorithmic agents mean we can hope for this to be worked out sooner rather than later, and social norms might help figure out the rest.

## We need interaction models for background connectedness

As connectivity retreats more and more into the background - as it becomes more calm - **legibility for humans might get worse even as quality of life increases.**

This is a clear challenge for the interaction design community, albeit a hard one. 

It's also a challenge not entirely unique to the connected home: In the context of smart cities, wearable tech, and even connected cars we increasingly see similar challenges.

In order to get there, we might need to evolve a vocabulary for all these types of interactions we will be increasingly facing that today we simply don't have the words for.

## Key takeaways

- The connected home is not yet human-readable.
- We need to find a way for the home to communicate its expectation to its users, and vice versa.
- We need to design interaction models for background connectedness.
- We need to evolve our vocabulary for these new types of interactions.
