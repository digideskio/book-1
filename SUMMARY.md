* Machine-readable
  * Machines <> Machines
* Going forward

#### New layers?

    Possibly, given the complexity of these new interactions, there are new "readable" layers to consider. This book just outlines them. Such as: environment-readable (i.e. many sensors, users and connected devices), context-readable (i.e. time and location, from home to city), and network-readable (i.e. complex social data/relationships)?


#### Mediating across layers

    How can interactions and understanding be mediated across the human-readable and machine-readable layers? Here we discuss the idea of a "user agent" that translates and negotiates across the layers. Historically, this has been metaphor-based software (GUIs) like the browser or mobile operating system. It might look different going forward. 


### What are smart, connected products

    "Smart" means an object that senses (takes input from the environment), thinks (computes, often on the cloud) and then acts (carries out an action or signals for something to happen.). When these objects are physical and networked together and to other services via the internet, they are smart, connected products. 


#### Sensing
#### Thinking
#### Acting


### Connected literacy

    We briefly define what "literacy" means in connected spaces and why it is essential. 


#### Reading
#### Writing
#### Participating

## Scenarios

    These scenarios bring the concepts to life and surface opportunities for innovation and possible conflicts.


### [What to invite into your home]

## Methodologies and case studies

    Here we show case some ways we've explored these topics in the last months, focusing on the insights and resources that can help others in their own investigations. 


### Prototyping
    * [UX of privacy]
    * [Methodologies]
### Policy
    * [Smart Cities...]
    * [Surveillance...]

## To explore further

    And there are ways to take these ideas forward, through research, further publications, and other considerations.
