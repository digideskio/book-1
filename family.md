## Rights management

1. **Rights managements is hard to understand.** If you've ever encountered a situation where you needed to assign read/write/execute rights for a personal computer, server or network without proper training, you'll know how confusing this is - even professionals regularly fail at considering the exact rights settings. In a connected home we'd have to assume that there are layers of access rights for building/apartment/room/device, or something along those lines - all of which would be non-intuitive to handle. Screw-ups seem unavoidable.

## Malware 

2. **How about malware?** What if your smart fridge offers a back door that allows criminals to steal your email password ([like when it happened in August 2015](http://bgr.com/2015/08/25/samsung-smart-fridge-hack-gmail/))? [Why does your TV listen in on what you say in the living room?](http://www.iflscience.com/technology/it-s-not-just-your-tv-listening-your-conversation) How do we deal with government and non-government entities that use our devices and white ware to spy on us [like they did with smartphones](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/28517/20150124/edward-snowden-apple-iphone-with-secret-ifeature-that-allows-government-to-spy-on-you.htm)? What will be the [rootkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit) of the connected home? What will the malware look like that takes control of the connected home infrastructure, what will it do, and who will be behind it? Will it allow criminals and governments to listen in on your conversations, or allow the music and movie industry to shut down your TV and stereo if they suspect pirated copyrighted content in your apartment?
