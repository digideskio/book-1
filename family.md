A look at safety, root access and nurturing scenarios in a family home. 

## Safety

## Root access

Your home is yours alone. And unless you share the key with someone, only you have access. Right? But that may be about to change: With connectivity come power struggles and access & rights management as well as security issues.

Let's consider the following, loosely sorted in order of ascending maliciousness:

1. **Rights managements is hard to understand.** If you've ever encountered a situation where you needed to assign read/write/execute rights for a personal computer, server or network without proper training, you'll know how confusing this is - even professionals regularly fail at considering the exact rights settings. In a connected home we'd have to assume that there are layers of access rights for building/apartment/room/device, or something along those lines - all of which would be non-intuitive to handle. Screw-ups seem unavoidable.
2. **How about malware?** What if your smart fridge offers a back door that allows criminals to steal your email password ([like when it happened in August 2015](http://bgr.com/2015/08/25/samsung-smart-fridge-hack-gmail/))? [Why does your TV listen in on what you say in the living room?](http://www.iflscience.com/technology/it-s-not-just-your-tv-listening-your-conversation) How do we deal with government and non-government entities that use our devices and white ware to spy on us [like they did with smartphones](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/28517/20150124/edward-snowden-apple-iphone-with-secret-ifeature-that-allows-government-to-spy-on-you.htm)? What will be the [rootkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit) of the connected home? What will the malware look like that takes control of the connected home infrastructure, what will it do, and who will be behind it? Will it allow criminals and governments to listen in on your conversations, or allow the music and movie industry to shut down your TV and stereo if they suspect pirated copyrighted content in your apartment?
3. **Who has root to your home?** [Root access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) is what we call full, unfettered access - including the rights to shut out other users or delete all data. Who are the parties who have this kind of access to your home? Is it going to be you? The landlord, owner, or renter? What about assisted living situations - is it the resident or the care facility? This is a situation we'll need to tackle at least partially through social norms, but also through some kind of legal framework so we can make sure the residents are in charge of their home.
