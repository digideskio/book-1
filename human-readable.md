# Human-readable

These are layers that humans can, or should be able to, read.  [diagram?]

## Human <> Human

This is the most common interaction upon which all of society is based. A home is full of human <> human interaction. 

## Human <> Machine

This is an interaction used most commonly when thinking of products. Single user, single machine. Example: a toaster. 

## Human <> Machines

Increasingly, humans are interacting with multiple machines, or more accurately, systems. 

## Humans <> Machines

With further complexity are interactions among multiple people and complex systems. Think shared living spaces with many devices, services and user preferences.
