# Who controls your home?

A look at safety, root access and nurturing scenarios in a family home. The ways families share their homes might be one of the most culturally specific and contextual. Connectivity is unlikely to change that dynamic too much, but it should have a profound impact nonetheless. Let's take a look at some of the basic implications of connectivity and domesticity.

## Root access

Your home is yours alone - unless it isn't and you share with someone. Right? But that may be about to change: With connectivity come power struggles and access & rights management as well as security issues.

Let's consider the following, loosely sorted in order of ascending maliciousness:

**Who has root to your home?** [Root access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) is what we call full, unfettered access - including the rights to shut out other users or delete all data. Who are the parties who have this kind of access to your home? Is it going to be you? The landlord, owner, or renter? What about assisted living situations - is it the resident or the care facility? This is a situation we'll need to tackle at least partially through social norms, but also through some kind of legal framework so we can make sure the residents are in charge of their home. 

It's the cases around root access that we find most interesting and threatening. It's likely that all kinds of parties will try to leverage control over an apartment against its residents. To mention just a few examples of how this could go all kinds of wrong, consider the following scenarios:

- We have already seen cases where [leased cars won't start](https://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/class-war-meets-the-war-on-gen.html) if the lease payments are overdue - a truly malicious, out of proportion invasion of privacy. 
- Imagine a health insurance that will track if a diabetic takes any sweet beverage or food out of the fridge, and reports back or blocks access to the fridge to begin with.
- What happens if a crooked land lord pressures residents to move out by messing with the houses lighting and heating systems?

This is where we'll see truly ugly power struggles play out. This is going to get ugly before it gets better.
