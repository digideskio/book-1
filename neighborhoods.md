_How can connected homes contribute to a healthier neighborhood, and how can it offer residents a better ambient understanding of what's happening in the neighborhood?_

Connected homes seem to hold tremendous potential to improve the neighborhood, and to allow residents to be more present.

We see great potential especially around the following areas:

**Increasing ambient awareness**
What kind of information and data about their neighborhood would be useful for residents? Traffic, crime statistics, peaks and valleys of energy consumption? Increase and decrease in the flow of people in the streets? Sharp changes in the number of tweets sent or photos shared online? Local weather data like temperature changes and rainfall? 

How can we communicate these types of data to increase ambient awareness without the blunt instrument of screens? How about ambient sounds like birdsong, glowing lights, water sloshing in a tank, a Tempescope [^1], a Good Night Lamp [^2], a fan spinning faster, a cookoo clock, a vibration [^3] through jewelry or the armchair?

What are the most useful, least intrusive models of notification? Should these alerts - be they ever so subtle - be sent when something changes (*state change*), when something is wrong (*alert*) or continues to be ok (*affirmation*), when cartain milestones are reached (*positive notification*), or continuously as an ongoing background ambient awareness system (*monitoring*)?  

**Contributing data to the commons**
What types of data are both useful and safe to share with the neighborhood and city beyond? What services can be built on top of data like that to save energy, reduce waste, increase production of energy, enable more rich social interactions?

What levels of community data are there (building, street, neighborhood, zip code...) and what frameworks would be most appropriate to apply? We need to figure out models to use community and neighborhood data to build better services for citizens while protecting privacy and security, and with inclusivity and diversity in mind.

**Retail and commercial use**
Traditionally, private business has been very data savvy in terms of value extraction and creation. There is huge potential value for retail and commercial uses of data from homes, buildings, and neighborhoods. What kind of services improve lives of citizens, tourists, and other stakeholders? What kind of obligations should be tied to using these types of data commercially? What does that mean for transparency, APIs, licensing, policy and political work?

**Foster stronger social relationships**
How can connected homes and the data systems surrounding them help residents have a richer social life? Can residents be empowered to more easily meet or help each other, or to resolve problems or social tensions? Can it be a tool for networked social action and participation?



[^1]: [The Tempescope](http://www.tempescope.com/) is a connected object that sits on your shelf and creates a contained weather environment. It can read weather conditions and forecasts from the internet and generate that environment within the object, complete with clouds, lightning and more.
[^2]: Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino's [Good Night Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com/) is a family of lamps set up in different locations: If the larger lamp is turned on, it will signal to the smaller lamps to turn on as well. They are beautiful objects that send an ambient social signal.
[^3]: What information these various vibrations could best convey is still somewhat uncharted territory, but Iskander Smit has done some [thoughtful research and design dismystifying vibration notifications]((https://medium.com/the-startup-magazine-collection/design-for-timely-interactions-b7d7b3ef5d50), including the dimensions and range of these signals as well as what parts of the body or environment would convey what kind of information.
