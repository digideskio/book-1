*Today, multiple users interact with multiple machines to form complex computational networks. Through simple physical interfaces, IoT can offer users better understanding and control of data. The foundation of this kind of augmentation is already in the hands of billions of people thanks to their first IoT device: a smartphone.* 

## Multiple users, multiple machines

The era of the single user interacting with a single machine is, for all intents and purposes, over. 

Today, we use machines that are networked with one another and enable us to interact with millions if not billions of people. Digital services today are served through our laptops, smartphones, transport kiosks, banking terminals and countless other forms of physical peripherals and digital interfaces. 

We participate in real-time communication and collaboration across great distances. We can view and modify complex online systems by changing our user profiles across platforms, chatting in interwoven communication threads, and make decisions and purchases based on the analysis of huge data sets. 

Now is an era of multimodality. Thanks to our pervasive and powerful computing environments, we communicate with each other and to machines across text, sound, image and languages. We are increasingly multiliterate. We know how to shift between these modes and understand the affordances and limitations of each.     

Through these interactions, enormous amounts of data are being produced. Already in 2012, 2.5 billion gigabytes of data was generated every day, according to IBM.[^1]

There is a lot opportunity in the volume, variety and velocity of processing all of this data. When we think about the connected home, we see it as an integral part of these complex computational systems. Our interactions can call upon and contribute to these massive data sets, if we make them in a way that is readable and writable to us.  


## Simple interfaces to complex systems

When these complex systems are visible and modifiable for everyday users, we learn about about how they work. This visibility can lead us to knowingly change our own behavior to get the outcomes we want. This learning cycle can be a tool of user empowerment.

For example, let's take a look at Toyota's hybrid electric car, the Prius. 

It offers drivers a dashboard showing how the car uses and stores energy. Most users would be unfamiliar with how electric car engines worked, let alone how their driving behavior affects energy consumption. However, by reading real-time information, people can observe how their behavior changes the system and adjust their driving accordingly.[^2]

Now looking beyond digital displays, the Internet of Things has the potential to not only offer simple visual interfaces, but physical ones. Connected objects can enable this kind of user empowerment and feedback loop. 

As we continue to explore this field, we will consider how users might observe complex systems and make modifications. We'll look at the affordances of physical objects, such as touch, sound, movement and light, as "human-readable" interaction. And we'll examine how IoT might extend or even replace the digital displays we have around us, further augmenting our computational abilities while maintaining the users' understanding and control of the system.  

## The smartphone is an entry point to augmentation

The foundation of this kind of augmentation is already in the hands of billions of people thanks to their first IoT device: a smartphone.

According to GSMA, 2.4 billion people are online via a mobile phone.[^3] These phones generally have the ability to sense the environment around them: location, acceleration, sound, etc. And they can connect to the internet, and therefore tap into large, computational networks.  

Because of the smartphone's inherent connectivity, its computational power and its pervasiveness, we're increasingly seeing appliances and peripherals that connect to the phone. Think wearables like fitness trackers or more advanced tools like virtual reality equipment or even medical devices like blood pressure monitors. Many of the important players in the connected home field are manufacturers of smartphones and/or provide operating systems for them. 

Therefore, when connected homes become more prevalent, it will likely be built primarily in compatibility with smartphones. 

Today we have a glimpse of what widespread augmentation looks like. And it's already in our pockets.
