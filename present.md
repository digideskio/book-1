*Today, multiple users interact with multiple machines to form complex computational networks. Through simple physical interfaces, IoT can offer users better understanding and control of data. The foundation of this kind of augmentation is already in the hands of billions of people thanks to their first IoT device: a smartphone.* 

## Multiple users, multiple machines

The era of the single user interacting with a single machine is, for all intents and purposes, over. 

Today, we use machines that are networked with one another and enable us to interact with millions if not billions of people. Digital services today are served through our laptops, smartphones, transport kiosks, banking terminals and countless other forms of physical peripherals and digital interfaces. 

We participate in real-time communication and collaboration across great distances. We can view and modify complex online systems by changing our user profiles across platforms, chatting in interwoven communication threads, and make decisions and purchases based on the analysis of huge data sets. 

Now is an era of multimodality. Thanks to our pervasive and powerful computing environments, we communicate with each other and to machines across text, sound, image and languages. We are increasingly multiliterate. We know how to shift between these modes and understand the affordances and limitations of each.     

Through these interactions, enormous amounts of data are being produced. Already in 2012, 2.5 billion gigabytes of data was generated every day, according to IBM.[^1]

There is a lot opportunity in the volume, variety and velocity of processing all of this data. When we think about the connected home, we see it as an integral part of these complex computational systems. Our interactions can call upon and contribute to these massive data sets, if we make them in a way that is readable and writable to us.  


## Simple interfaces to complex systems

When these complex systems are visible and modifiable for everyday users, we learn about about how they work. This visibility can lead us to knowingly change our own behavior to get the outcomes we want. This learning cycle can be a tool of user empowerment.

For example, let's take a look at Toyota's hybrid electric car, the Prius. 

It offers drivers a dashboard showing how the car uses and stores energy. Most users would be unfamiliar with how electric car engines worked, let alone how their driving behavior affects energy consumption. However, by reading real-time information, people can observe how their behavior changes the system and adjust their driving accordingly.[^2]

Now looking beyond digital displays, the Internet of Things has the potential to not only offer simple visual interfaces, but physical ones. Connected objects can enable this kind of user empowerment and feedback loop. 

As we continue to explore this field, we will consider how users might observe complex systems and make modifications. We'll look at the affordances of physical objects, such as touch, sound, movement and light, as "human-readable" interaction. And we'll examine how IoT might extend or even replace the digital displays we have around us, further augmenting our computational abilities while maintaining the users' understanding and control of the system.  

## The smartphone is an entry point to augmentation

### There aren't many connected homes

Over the last few months, we've made a point of asking a lot of people which connected objects they have in their houses (not counting smartphones, tablets, laptops). It wasn't many. 

Even in this almost ludicrously biased-towards-early-adopters group We talked to you hardly find any connectedness: Some game consoles and smart TVs, yes. Some NEST thermostats, a Philips Hue lightbulb here and there, sure. But that was about it. (In our home, there are some bluetooth speakers and we had a set of Alex's lovely [Good Night Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com) before we brought them to [Casa Jasmina](http://casajasmina.arduino.cc) as house warming gifts. That's just about it.)

The reasons are simple, and even this group of early adopters - many of who design connected products and services for a living - everybody has been blunt about it: The current offerings offer (mostly) fairly marginal value, or aren't compatible with either other technical platforms or (more interestingly) social norms. 

**If we had to summarize the overall response in one sentence, it'd be: "I just don't need it."**

And that's _very_ interesting. Because everybody agrees there's a huge market in connecting the home, and most would simultaneously agree that as a user the things offered don't make a whole lot of sense at least to the wider public.

<strong>The home is first and foremost a safe space. A place of retreat and relaxation. A space that must never be challenging, but supportive. If we add any complexity or complication to the home, we chip away at its core functionality.</strong>


### How will the connected home start?

In a recent conversation a software developer friend asked where we see the smart home going, where we were standing on the issue: It's hard to tell. 

One the one hand we're convinced that connectivity will definitively seep in to our homes, like it does everywhere else. On the other hand we find the current manifestations somewhere along the spectrum between "somewhat boring" and "super creepy". 

So the way we're approaching this whole field is with as much of a beginner's mind as we can: Trying to figure out what the questions are that we need to ask; what the real issues are. 

As for adaption of connectivity inside our homes, we have no doubt that it will happen. Not out of some techno-deterministic world view, but because we learned over the last couple of decades that connectivity & data add value to all parts of our lives if done right. 

We assume that the ways this will happen will seem odd for a while, and that it will happen not along the lines of well-established metaphors like automation or personalization: These will likely seem as quirky and ridiculous in hindsight as the futuristic computerized kitchen did in the 1950s (both in terms of gender roles and the technological aspects):

Rather, the smart will manifest in ways both banal and novel, and the vector will (hopefully, and most likely) be smarts that are "on the user", in whichever way. If we had to guess, we'd say they will be probably fairly low-tech, bottom up interventions that just make things a little easier, more interesting, more useful: **A connected home should help us be more human, more ourselves.**

Much more tricky is how we will deal with our preferences regarding various levels of scanning, sharing data, and (by extension) surveillance.

### Automation is a natural first step

The connected home products we see on the market today (or judging by conversations with many manufacturers and designers working in the field, on the way to market) focus to a large degree on home automation. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a natural first step. It's (comparatively) simple and offers a clear value (if done right), so it's (again, comparatively) low-hanging fruit.

Inarguably, there's a lot to be gained for users from home automation. Nobody would argue with the convenience and time savings of a laundry machine, a dishwasher or a vacuum cleaner. 

The same will hold true for many connected home appliances. The true automation magic might, however, not happen at the device level. Everyone who ever had to install one smartphone app per connected home device - thermostat, lightbulb, smart lock - will agree, the trick might turn out to be smart integration at the software layer: One app to rule them all. 

Maybe more importantly, automation does not require a lot of explanation: _I used to regulate my heater by hand, now it self-regulates._ Simple to understand, no explanation needed.

Shortcoming: 
> the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably "informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is".

* Train devices with machine learning: the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
