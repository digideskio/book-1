*Today, multiple users interact with multiple machines to form complex computational networks. Through simple physical interfaces, IoT can offer users better understanding and control. The foundation of this augmentation is already in the hands of billions of people thanks to their first IoT device: a smartphone.* 

## Multiple users, multiple machines



* Many users now using many devices
  * multimodality: multimodality describes communication practices in terms of the textual, aural, linguistic, spatial, and visual resources - or modes - used to compose messages.
  * leading to "multiliteracy"
* Lots of data is being generated. 
  * The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[7] as of 2012[update], every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5Ã—1018) of data is created.[8] 
* A lot of research and opportunity around how data is collected, processed and decisions made based on it. 
  * Volume. The quantity of generated and stored data
  * Variety. The type and nature of the data. 
  * Velocity. The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. 




## Physical interfaces to complex systems

* IoT = physicality. A simple interface to bigger computational systems. 
* Making these systems visible can change behavior, like Toyota Prius.

### There aren't many connected homes

Over the last few months, we've made a point of asking a lot of people which connected objects they have in their houses (not counting smartphones, tablets, laptops). It wasn't many. 

Even in this almost ludicrously biased-towards-early-adopters group We talked to you hardly find any connectedness: Some game consoles and smart TVs, yes. Some NEST thermostats, a Philips Hue lightbulb here and there, sure. But that was about it. (In our home, there are some bluetooth speakers and we had a set of Alex's lovely [Good Night Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com) before we brought them to [Casa Jasmina](http://casajasmina.arduino.cc) as house warming gifts. That's just about it.)

The reasons are simple, and even this group of early adopters - many of who design connected products and services for a living - everybody has been blunt about it: The current offerings offer (mostly) fairly marginal value, or aren't compatible with either other technical platforms or (more interestingly) social norms. 

**If we had to summarize the overall response in one sentence, it'd be: "I just don't need it."**

And that's _very_ interesting. Because everybody agrees there's a huge market in connecting the home, and most would simultaneously agree that as a user the things offered don't make a whole lot of sense at least to the wider public.

<strong>The home is first and foremost a safe space. A place of retreat and relaxation. A space that must never be challenging, but supportive. If we add any complexity or complication to the home, we chip away at its core functionality.</strong>


### How will the connected home start?

In a recent conversation a software developer friend asked where we see the smart home going, where we were standing on the issue: It's hard to tell. 

One the one hand we're convinced that connectivity will definitively seep in to our homes, like it does everywhere else. On the other hand we find the current manifestations somewhere along the spectrum between "somewhat boring" and "super creepy". 

So the way we're approaching this whole field is with as much of a beginner's mind as we can: Trying to figure out what the questions are that we need to ask; what the real issues are. 

As for adaption of connectivity inside our homes, we have no doubt that it will happen. Not out of some techno-deterministic world view, but because we learned over the last couple of decades that connectivity & data add value to all parts of our lives if done right. 

We assume that the ways this will happen will seem odd for a while, and that it will happen not along the lines of well-established metaphors like automation or personalization: These will likely seem as quirky and ridiculous in hindsight as the futuristic computerized kitchen did in the 1950s (both in terms of gender roles and the technological aspects):

Rather, the smart will manifest in ways both banal and novel, and the vector will (hopefully, and most likely) be smarts that are "on the user", in whichever way. If we had to guess, we'd say they will be probably fairly low-tech, bottom up interventions that just make things a little easier, more interesting, more useful: **A connected home should help us be more human, more ourselves.**

Much more tricky is how we will deal with our preferences regarding various levels of scanning, sharing data, and (by extension) surveillance.

### Automation is a natural first step

The connected home products we see on the market today (or judging by conversations with many manufacturers and designers working in the field, on the way to market) focus to a large degree on home automation. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a natural first step. It's (comparatively) simple and offers a clear value (if done right), so it's (again, comparatively) low-hanging fruit.

Inarguably, there's a lot to be gained for users from home automation. Nobody would argue with the convenience and time savings of a laundry machine, a dishwasher or a vacuum cleaner. 

The same will hold true for many connected home appliances. The true automation magic might, however, not happen at the device level. Everyone who ever had to install one smartphone app per connected home device - thermostat, lightbulb, smart lock - will agree, the trick might turn out to be smart integration at the software layer: One app to rule them all. 

Maybe more importantly, automation does not require a lot of explanation: _I used to regulate my heater by hand, now it self-regulates._ Simple to understand, no explanation needed.

Shortcoming: 
> the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably "informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is".
