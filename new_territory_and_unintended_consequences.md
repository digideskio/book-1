# New territory and unintended consequences

This means there's new things to explore: How users interact with each other and these systems, how preferences are negotiated, and how conflicts are resolved. 

Implications and unintended consequences. Examples of how this has looked in the past and possible "threats" now. This highlights the urgency of figuring these questions out. 


## Vectors

As of today, we're working under the assumption that it will take another 10 years or so for most homes to cross some kind of "connectedness threshold" - with the notable exception (and we're painting in broad strokes here) of Asia's mega cities, where often large-scale network infrastructure is dropped right into the new buildings to a much higher degree than in many Western cities, where retro-fitting is a bigger thing.

The way we will get used to the technologies, and where we will thus also develop the social norms around these kind of new interactions, is most likely through **the vectors of retail spaces, office buildings, and hotels**: Interstitial, transactional contexts where we engage much more openly with infrastructure due to the temporary nature of the interaction. Places where we are more accepting of privacy-diminishing interactions if they either come with a net gain or if they seem, frankly, simply unavoidable. Then, over time, these things will find their ways into our homes.
