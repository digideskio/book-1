# Augmentation not automation 

## [Move Engelbart to Context > In the Past] 

A pioneer in human-machine interfaces and a solver of unusual problems, Doug Engelbart - inventor of the computer mouse, among other things - had a mantra: _augmentation not automation_. 

Engelbart's work focused on the human intellect and how to improve it. Yet, his [framework conceptual for augmenting the human intellect](http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) can guide our exploration of the connected home, too. 

He aimed to increase a human's capability to approach a complex problem situation, meaning "more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, **speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble.**" (emphasis ours)

Let's veer away from the human intellect and focus on the role of technology in general, and in the connected home in particular. Technology - and the various pieces of tech in the connected home - should aim to augment us as well, to help us be more human, more ourselves. It should offer us speedier, better solutions, and solve problems that previously seems insoluble.

## Automation is a natural first step

The connected home products we see on the market today (or judging by conversations with many manufacturers and designers working in the field, on the way to market) focus to a large degree on home automation. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a natural first step. It's (comparatively) simple and offers a clear value (if done right), so it's (again, comparatively) low-hanging fruit.

Inarguably, there's a lot to be gained for users from home automation. Nobody would argue with the convenience and time savings of a laundry machine, a dishwasher or a vacuum cleaner. 

The same will hold true for many connected home appliances. The true automation magic might, however, not happen at the device level. Everyone who ever had to install one smartphone app per connected home device - thermostat, lightbulb, smart lock - will agree, the trick might turn out to be smart integration at the software layer: One app to rule them all. 

Maybe more importantly, automation does not require a lot of explanation: _I used to regulate my heater by hand, now it self-regulates._ Simple to understand, no explanation needed.

## Key takeaways

- Automation is just a first step.
- The key is augmenting users to solve problems more easily, to give them super powers.
- Introducing connectivity into a safe place like the home requires a clear value proposition and very good explanation.
