We believe that the connected home should be based on foundational principles and values. These should guide the design and implementation process from beginning to end.

Ethics need to be considered on the strategic level, and are implmented at design level. This where designers of connected home products and services will need to invest extraordinary efforts to implement foundational principles such as:

- **Security:** Networked systems are inherently prone to hard-to-predict failure and abuses.
- **Sustainability:** Not just materials need to be high-quality enough to stay in our homes for long times, but also the software side of things. If the software that runs a smoke detector or oven or smart lock stops working 5 years from now, we're in deep trouble.
- **User empowerment:** The user needs to be the one (and only) party in control of their home devices.
- **Privacy by design:** No other parties may sniff the users data and share it with other parties.

As we come to rely more and more on connected services in our daily lives, **user righs effectively start to equal citizen rights**. These rights need to be protected on the product level as well as the policy level.


[^1 ]This list is likely to evolve over time as we come to explore more edge cases and scenarios. Additionally, as part of the Good Home project, we drafted a list of more concrete [design values](http://thegoodhome.org/values/) which we add here as a further inspiration: Networked, communal, interdependant, participatory, readable, open, humble, adaptable, hackable, diverse, resilient, respectful, sustainable, perfect imperfection, one size does not fit all, local, careful, provocative, post-capitalistic, constrictively critical.
