Prior to the rise of connected devices, human-to-machine interaction was primarily based on a single user interacting with a single machine. Now, in the connected home, there are multiple users interacting with multiple machines, sometimes separated by physical distance, time and preferences. 

These are complex interactions, with opportunities for innovation and possible unintended consequences. 

At the same time, we're looking at how our homes will be "updated" at very different time scales: from the building's architecture which is usually measured in decades, to the building infrastructure such as electricity, plumbing etc which is measured in years, to interior furniture and design in fewer years, to devices and appliances in 18-month cycles to digital services and apps which can be just months.
