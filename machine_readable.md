# Machine-readable

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

How machines talk to each other is a place for a lot of technical research and standards building. This book lightly covers it. 

Naturally, as connected devices enter the home, it is beneficial if they can talk to each and to devices in other connected spaces. That means there will need to be a layer of interpretation and interaction that is intended for machines to read. 

Typically, this kind of layer is hard for a human to read. Nevertheless, through **[organizing and structuring data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) following certain conventions,** machines can read it effectively and that information can then be translated into a more human-readable form. 

There is a lot of technical work to be done designing this layer well. Through decades of developing network technology and international standards, there are established tactics for building inter-operability among machines and their data.  

If done correctly, the machine-readable layer can be incredibly powerful. However, since it is hard for most people to read it directly, we need to ensure that there are ways to trust and verify what is happening at the machine-to-machine level. That way devices can honor what the user wants and cooperates well with other devices, datasets and systems. 

## Machines <> Machines

There are considerations around metadata that conveys humans' preferences, ways for machines to talk better with one another, and ways of structuring the network to facilitate this. [principle to include here: humans should have the ability to still see/manipulate what's going on here]

## Going forward

Should machines be able to read human <> human interactions to offer contextual services?
