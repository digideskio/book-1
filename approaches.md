# Approaches

Over the last year, we've experimented with various ways of exploring the questions surrounding the connected home.

We're trying out a wide range of formats and research methods and are happy to share our experiences with them so far, as well as learn about new approaches.

Content sprints are a great way to do a first quick collaborative deep-dive into a topic as complex as connected homes.

Designing speculative prototypes is a worthwhile way to make complex, abstract issues more graspable, and an exhibition can provide helpful deadlines and a platform for sharing these ideas with the public.

We hope that this can be useful to others in their own investigations, and we'll certainly keep experimenting with these and other formats.
