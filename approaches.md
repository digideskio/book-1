There are many way of exploring the manyfold questions surrounding the connected home. It's a great opportunity to experiment with applying a wide range of formats and research methods. Over the last year we have tried a few of them and are happy to share these experiences:

Content sprints are a great way to do a first quick collaborative deep-dive into a topic as complex as connected homes.

Designing speculative prototypes is a worthwhile way to make complex, abstract issues more graspable, and an exhibition can provide helpful deadlines.

We hope that this can be useful to others in their own investigations. In the meantime, we will keep experimenting with these and other formats.
