*As the home is defined by relationships, we explore how connectedness changes relationships and power dynamics to surface opportunities for innovation and possible conflicts.*

We believe that the home - connected or not - should primarily be a place that fosters human-to-human interactions. But humen-to-human relationships are not the only ones that come to play in a connected home.

Relationships are shaped by power dynamics. Many are old and well established, for better or worse. Others take on a new meaning, or have a new twist, in a connected environment:

**Guest & host:** How does hosting change in a connected environment? The ground rules of being a good guest or host will remain the same in the 21st century, but the ways they will manifest are likely to change.

**Sharing connected objects:** How does data change the way we share domestic objects? A look at sharing connected objects the design opportunities around them.

**Home & data:** The connected home is a computer. If we live inside a computer, how do we handle and maintain our data? How does data change the way we live in a house or move in and out?

**Who has control?** As homes become more connected and software-based, the thorny issues of access and rights control become salient: Who controls your home's infrastructure?

**The connected things we surround ourselves with:** What to invite: How do we choose which connected objects to invite into our homes?

**The home in the focus of commercial tracking and government surveillance:** Surveilance and tracking are a serious problem for the internet of things and the connected home: We need to build safeguards against mass-surveillance through the connected appliances in our homes.
