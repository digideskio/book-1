The following scenarios bring the concepts to life and surface opportunities for innovation and possible conflicts.

We believe that the home - connected or not - should primarily be a place that fosters human-to-human interactions. Relationships are shaped by power dynamics. Many are old and well established, for better or worse. Others take on a new meaning, or have a new twist, in a connected environment.  It is through this lens that we'll take a look at relationships and human-to-human interactions in this chapter.
