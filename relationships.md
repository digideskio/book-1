# Relationships

## DONE

We believe that a home, whether connected or not, should primarily serve the humans in it.

Products and services we make should augment and respect human relationships. And, as more computation enters the home, we must be aware of how some human interactions and scenarios may take on new norms and considerations.  

**Hospitality.** How does hospitality change in a connected environment? Certainly there are timeless elements of etiquette. Nevertheless, there might be new ways we interact when we're a guest in someone's connected home. 

**Sharing connected objects.** In a household, it's common to share lots of objects. From appliances to furniture to toys and media and more, what are the design opportunities that await when we think about sharing connected objects?

**Home & data.** The connected home is a computer. What happens to its data when we move? What does it look like for residents to use and maintain data about their home? What role does connectivity play when buying and selling a home?

**Who has control?** As homes become more connected and software-based, questions around access and rights control become acute. Who controls your home's infrastructure? What rights does the city have, or the neighbors, or different members of a household? How are those permission levels negotiated?

**The connected things we surround ourselves with.** What criteria do we use to decide what connected objects to invite into our homes? How do we evaluate when we want to own something or not?

**The home as a target for commercial tracking and government surveillance.** If a device has the ability to track and record you, it's likely that it will, even when you don't want it to. Advertisers, governments and criminals alike will use the Internet of Things to track our behavior to an even greater degree than today. We need to build safeguards against commerical and government surveillance and protections against abuse.
