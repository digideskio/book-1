# Ambient Notifications

As you go about your day in your connected home, it'd be **a bit nightmarish to have a million blinking lights** and glowing displays conveying to you the status of every possible device. 

Instead, how can we design **less intrusive and more aesthetically pleasing notifications**? 

## Soundscapes

**Sound is a common element in notifications.** Your phone rings when you get a call, your email pings when you receive a new message, and your doorbell chimes when you have a visitor. 

How can we use sounds in a connected home, **especially if a lot of devices and sensors are at work simultaneously?** 

One idea would be to create **soundscapes that could convey a lot of information.** 

**We often find this in nature.** For example, a jungle soundscape you can hear the weather (rain? wind?). You can hear what animals are nearby (the crunch of the leaves, the swish of some vines, the chattering of little mammals). If you are attuned to it, you can pick out individual species and sometimes even understand what they are communicating, like when birds send each other warnings if a predator is approaching.

What if we used a **similar layering of sounds in the home?** And one were attuned to what they indicated? This would not have to be garish or extremely loud; instead, subtle updates using **birdsong or the sound of falling rain** could indicate the status of your home. 

## Glanceables 

Visual notifications are another way to convey information. 

We could also imagine displays and objects that tell you something in a subtle and pleasing way. 

For example, **[the Tempescope](http://www.tempescope.com/) is a connected object that sits on your shelf and creates a contained weather environment.** It can read weather conditions and forecasts from the internet and generate that environment within the object, complete with clouds, lightning and more. 

The [Good Night Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com/) is another example of **a beautiful object that notifies you in ambient way.** A family of lamps are set up in different locations, and if the larger lamp is turned on, it will signal to the smaller lamps to turn on as well. 

This kind of **gentle and aesthetically pleasing visual notification** could be applied to many objects and scenarios.   

## Vibrations

Continuing on kinds of notifications, we've seen **motors and vibrations used to signal different information** as well. 

The most common example perhaps is your phone, which can vibrate when it receives a call or message. This convention is showing up in wearable electronics, such as fitness trackers and smart watches, that vibrate for certain notifications as well. 

We could also imagine vibrations being used in the connected home, for example in furniture or appliances that need to signal something. That could come in the form of an alert, or even just to verify that everything's okay. 

It's still uncharted what information these various vibrations could convey, but Iskander Smit has done some **[thoughtful research and design dismystifying vibration notifications]((https://medium.com/the-startup-magazine-collection/design-for-timely-interactions-b7d7b3ef5d50)**, including the dimensions and range of these signals as well as what parts of the body or environment would convey what kind of information. 

## Key takeaways

The connected home doesn't have to be filled with obnoxious blimps and beeps. Instead, we can design subtle notifications using soundscapes, glanceable technology and even vibrations to convey a rich amount of data in an unobtrusive way.
