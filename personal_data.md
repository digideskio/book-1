# Protection of personal data

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

We advocate for considering data consent, portability, accountability, etc.

## Privacy by Design

   > * Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedial
* Privacy as the default setting
* Privacy embedded into design
* Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum
* End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection
* Visibility and transparency – keep it open
* Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric

## Privacy settings are set at a high level by default.

## Consent

Valid consent must be explicit for data collected and purposes data used. Consent must be verifiable. Data controllers must be able to prove "consent" (opt-in) and consent may be withdrawn.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation

## Data breaches

> Legal obligation to notify the Supervisory Authority without undue delay and this is also still subject to negotiations at present. The reporting of a data breach is not subject to any de minimis standard and it is likely that the GDPR will provide that such breaches must be reported to the Supervisory Authority as soon as they become aware of the data breach (Article 31). Individuals have to be notified if adverse impact is determined.

## Data deletion 

> the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to him on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data

## Data portability

> A person shall be able to transfer their personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used electronic format. The right to data portability is provided by Article 18 of the GDPR. [9] Legal experts see in the final version of this measure a "new right" created that "reaches beyond the scope of data portability between two controllers as stipulated in Article 18."[16]
