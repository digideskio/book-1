# Protection of personal data

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

We advocate for considering data consent, portability, accountability, etc.

## Privacy by Design

   > * Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedial
* Privacy as the default setting
* Privacy embedded into design
* Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum
* End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection
* Visibility and transparency – keep it open
* Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric
