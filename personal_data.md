# Protection of personal data

## WRITTEN?
## PROOFED?

We advocate the privacy must be a core value to be considered throughout the design, manufacture, usage and end of a connected product or service. 

Our home needs to be a safe space: *What happens at home needs to stay at home.* Data driven services put this safe space in serious danger, so we must build safeguards.

Specifically, that means building in safeguards like: 

- strong privacy default settings
- requiring clear and unambiguous consent from users
- plans for data breaches
- strict transparency rules
- options to delete data, and data portability

These will have to be backed by legal responsibility and accountability for the enabling industries like data service providers and technology companies. (As many connected home solutions are proposed by startups, it is especially important to also ensure that startups play by the same rules.)
 

## Privacy by design

Connected home systems should be private by design. [^1] Concretely, this means following ground rules like:

- Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial
- Privacy as the default setting
- Privacy embedded into design
- Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum
- End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection
- Visibility and transparency – keep it open
- Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric


## Consent

Valid consent must be explicit for data collected and purposes data used. Consent must be verifiable. Data controllers must be able to prove "consent" (opt-in) and consent may be withdrawn at any time. 

This is necessary. It is also a good practice that will ensure that users can trust services - so far, user acceptance of smart home products has been limited to say the least.


## Data breaches

In case a data breach occurs, there's already strong regulation in place: [^2]

> Legal obligation to notify the Supervisory Authority without undue delay and this is also still subject to negotiations at present. The reporting of a data breach is not subject to any de minimis standard and it is likely that the GDPR will provide that such breaches must be reported to the Supervisory Authority as soon as they become aware of the data breach (Article 31). Individuals have to be notified if adverse impact is determined.


## Data deletion 

Users should always be able to delete their data:

- the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to him on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data

## Data portability

> A person shall be able to transfer their personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used electronic format. The right to data portability is provided by Article 18 of the GDPR. [9] Legal experts see in the final version of this measure a "new right" created that "reaches beyond the scope of data portability between two controllers as stipulated in Article 18."[16]
