# Ambient Notifications

As you go about your day in your connected home, it'd be a bit nightmarish to have a million blinking lights and glowing displays conveying to you the status of every possible device. 

Instead, how can we design less intrusive and more aesthetically pleasing notifications? 


## Soundscapes

Sound is a common element in notifications. Your phone rings when you get a call, your email pings when you receive a new message, and your doorbell rings when you have a visitor. 

How can we use sounds in a connected home, especially if a lot of devices and sensors are at work simultaneously? 

One idea would be to create soundscapes that could convey a lot of information. We find this often in nature. For example, a jungle soundscape you can hear the weather (rain? wind?). You can hear what animals are nearby (the crunch of the leaves, the swish of some vines, the chattering of little mammals). I

f you are attuned to it, you can pick out individual species and sometimes even understand what they are communicating, like when birds send each other warnings if a predator is approaching.

What if we used a similar layering of sounds in the home? And one were attuned to what they indicated? This would not have to be garish or extremely loud. But perhaps subtle updates conveyed using birdsong or the sound of falling rain could indicate a status in your home. 

## Glanceables 

Visual notifications are another way to convey information. 

We could also imagine displays and objects that tell you something in a subtle and pleasing way. 

For example, [the Tempescope](http://www.tempescope.com/) is an object that sits on your shelf and creates a little weather environment. It can read weather conditions and forecasts from the internet and then generate that environment within the object, complete with clouds, lightning and more. 

The [Good Night Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com/) is another example of a beautiful object that notifies you in ambient way.  A family of lamps are set up in different locations, and if the larger lamp is turned on, it will signal to the smaller lamps to turn on as well. This kind of gentle and aesthetically pleasing notification could be applied to many objects and scenarios.   


## Vibrations

Continuing on kinds of notifications, we've seen motors and vibrations used to signal different information as well. The most common example perhaps is your phone, which can vibrate when it receives a call or message. This convention is showing up in wearable electronics, such as fitness trackers and smart watches, that vibrate for certain notificaitons as well. 

We could also imagine vibrations being used in the connected home, for example in furniture or appliances that need to signal something. That could come in the form of an alert, or even just to verify that everything's ok. 

A shared literacy for what information various vibrations actually convey is fuzzy at the moment, but [Iskander Smit](https://medium.com/the-startup-magazine-collection/design-for-timely-interactions-b7d7b3ef5d50) has done some thoughtful research and design dismystifying it, including what the dimensions and range of vibration notifications. 


## Key takeaways

The connected home doesn't have to be filled with obnoxious blimps and beeps. Instead, we can design subtle notifications using soundscapes, glanceable technology and even vibrations to convey a rich amount of data in an unintrusive way.
