# Principles

## TO WRITE: M
## PROOFED?

We believe that the connected home should be based on foundational principles. These are not new, but they are important to include at the beginning, as they guide what should and could be built. 

## Value-sensitive design 

Take human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the whole process, like privacy by design. 

## Ethics implmented at design level

One key aspect to this happens at the product design level, where designers of connected home products and services will need to invest extraordinary efforts into aspects like:

- **Security:** Networked systems are inherently prone to hard-to-predict failure and abuses.
- **Sustainability:** Not just materials need to be high-quality enough to stay in our homes for long times, but also the software side of things. If the software that runs a smoke detector or oven or smart lock stops working 5 years from now, we're in deep trouble.
- **User empowerment:** The user needs to be the one (and only) party in control of their home devices.
- **Privacy:** No other parties may sniff the users data and share it with other parties.
