# Residential Rights Management: Who controls your home?

#written?
#proofed?

If our homes become connected and hence more software-based, it will be software that grants or denies the rights to use and change everything that goes on inside the room. (At least everything that has a digital or data aspect to it.) This suggest that going forward, access and control over the home might work in a similar fashion as access and control over digital media content. 

## The problem with Digital Rights Management (DRM)

Enter Digital Rights Management - DRM for short. Time for a little refresher.

The world of commercially distributed digital content - movies, music, books - has been shaped by discussions about DRM: Digital Rights Management, or *Digital Restrictions Management* as some critics call it, is a set of technological systems that aim to control who can and who cannot access digital media, and under what conditions.

The concept sounds simple enough: Is this paid content? If so, has this user paid and is hence eligible to consume it?

But it isn't quite as simple. In fact, DRM is highly controversial: Because it works on the premise of restricting access, often it punishes legitimate customers. The files or streams a customer pays for are those with built-in restrictive technologies. In other words, the customer pays for damaged files, whereas a (potentially illegally) downloaded version would usually be free of such restrictions. 

If this sounds silly, it's because it is: A label can never predict how a buyer of music or film might want to consume the music they bought - yet often DRM measures restrict playback of a song or movie to certain devices, operating systems, or contexts. 

This is so confusing and limiting that even the very basic understanding of what happens when someone pays for a legal, legitimate download cannot be taken for granted: [^1] 

"In What We Buy When We "Buy Now", a paper forthcoming in The University of Pennsylvania Law Review, respected copyright scholars Aaron Perzanowski and Chris Jay Hoofnagle report on an experiment they set up to test what people clicking the "buy now" button on stores selling digital things (ebooks, games, music, videos, etc) think they get for their money -- it's not what they think."

And while as consumers in the digital ecosystem we need to raise media literacy, this is not primarily the users' fault. The study shows that retailers use misleading language all along: [^2]

"Retailers such as Apple and Amazon market digital media to consumers using the familiar language of product ownership, including phrases like “buy now,” “own,” and “purchase.” Consumers may understandably associate such language with strong personal property rights. But the license agreements and terms of use associated with these transactions tell a different story. They explain that ebooks, mp3 albums, digital movies, games, and software are not sold, but merely licensed. The terms limit consumers' ability to resell, lend, transfer, and even retain possession of the digital media they acquire. Moreover, unlike physical media products, access to digital media is contingent — it depends on shifting business models, the success and failure of platforms, and often on the maintenance and availability of DRM authentication systems years after the consumer clicked “buy now.”"

Now we have to assume that similar challenges will arise around the connected home: Only there, the effect would be compounded. 

Let me be blunt: DRM for domestic infrastructure - Residential Rights Management if you will - should under no circumstance become part of our homes.



## Rights management

1. **Rights managements is hard to understand.** If you've ever encountered a situation where you needed to assign read/write/execute rights for a personal computer, server or network without proper training, you'll know how confusing this is - even professionals regularly fail at considering the exact rights settings. In a connected home we'd have to assume that there are layers of access rights for building/apartment/room/device, or something along those lines - all of which would be non-intuitive to handle. Screw-ups seem unavoidable.




A look at safety, root access and nurturing scenarios in a family home. The ways families share their homes might be one of the most culturally specific and contextual. Connectivity is unlikely to change that dynamic too much, but it should have a profound impact nonetheless. Let's take a look at some of the basic implications of connectivity and domesticity.

## Root access

Your home is yours alone - unless it isn't and you share with someone. Right? But that may be about to change: With connectivity come power struggles and access & rights management as well as security issues.

Let's consider the following, loosely sorted in order of ascending maliciousness:

**Who has root to your home?** [Root access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) is what we call full, unfettered access - including the rights to shut out other users or delete all data. Who are the parties who have this kind of access to your home? Is it going to be you? The landlord, owner, or renter? What about assisted living situations - is it the resident or the care facility? This is a situation we'll need to tackle at least partially through social norms, but also through some kind of legal framework so we can make sure the residents are in charge of their home. 

It's the cases around root access that we find most interesting and threatening. It's likely that all kinds of parties will try to leverage control over an apartment against its residents. To mention just a few examples of how this could go all kinds of wrong, consider the following scenarios:

- We have already seen cases where [leased cars won't start](https://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/class-war-meets-the-war-on-gen.html) if the lease payments are overdue - a truly malicious, out of proportion invasion of privacy. 
- Imagine a health insurance that will track if a diabetic takes any sweet beverage or food out of the fridge, and reports back or blocks access to the fridge to begin with.
- What happens if a crooked land lord pressures residents to move out by messing with the houses lighting and heating systems?

This is where we'll see truly ugly power struggles play out. This is going to get ugly before it gets better.
