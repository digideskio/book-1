## Rights management

1. **Rights managements is hard to understand.** If you've ever encountered a situation where you needed to assign read/write/execute rights for a personal computer, server or network without proper training, you'll know how confusing this is - even professionals regularly fail at considering the exact rights settings. In a connected home we'd have to assume that there are layers of access rights for building/apartment/room/device, or something along those lines - all of which would be non-intuitive to handle. Screw-ups seem unavoidable.
