# Residential Rights Management: Who controls your home?

_As homes become more connected and software-based, the thorny issues of access and rights control become salient: Who controls your home's infrastructure?_

When our homes become connected and hence more software-based, it will be software that grants or denies the rights to use and change everything that goes on inside the room. (At least everything that has a digital or data aspect to it.) This suggest that going forward, access and control over the home might work in a similar fashion as access and control over digital media content. 

## The problem with Digital Rights Management (DRM)

Enter Digital Rights Management - DRM for short. Time for a little refresher.

The world of commercially distributed digital content - movies, music, books - has been shaped by discussions about DRM: Digital Rights Management, or *Digital Restrictions Management* as some critics call it, is a set of technological systems that aim to control who can and who cannot access digital media, and under what conditions.

The concept sounds simple enough: Is this paid content? If so, has this user paid and is hence eligible to consume it?

But it isn't quite as simple. In fact, DRM is highly controversial: Because it works on the premise of restricting access, often it punishes legitimate customers. The files or streams a customer pays for are those with built-in restrictive technologies. In other words, the customer pays for damaged files, whereas a (potentially illegally) downloaded version would usually be free of such restrictions. 

If this sounds silly, it's because it is: A label can never predict how a buyer of music or film might want to consume the music they bought - yet often DRM measures restrict playback of a song or movie to certain devices, operating systems, or contexts. 

This is so confusing and limiting that even the very basic understanding of what happens when someone pays for a legal, legitimate download cannot be taken for granted: [^1] 

"In What We Buy When We "Buy Now", a paper forthcoming in The University of Pennsylvania Law Review, respected copyright scholars Aaron Perzanowski and Chris Jay Hoofnagle report on an experiment they set up to test what people clicking the "buy now" button on stores selling digital things (ebooks, games, music, videos, etc) think they get for their money -- it's not what they think."

And while as consumers in the digital ecosystem we need to raise media literacy, this is not primarily the users' fault. The study shows that retailers use misleading language all along: [^2]

"Retailers such as Apple and Amazon market digital media to consumers using the familiar language of product ownership, including phrases like “buy now,” “own,” and “purchase.” Consumers may understandably associate such language with strong personal property rights. But the license agreements and terms of use associated with these transactions tell a different story. They explain that ebooks, mp3 albums, digital movies, games, and software are not sold, but merely licensed. The terms limit consumers' ability to resell, lend, transfer, and even retain possession of the digital media they acquire. Moreover, unlike physical media products, access to digital media is contingent — it depends on shifting business models, the success and failure of platforms, and often on the maintenance and availability of DRM authentication systems years after the consumer clicked “buy now.”"

## DRM for the home: Residential Rights Management

Now we have to assume that similar challenges will arise around the connected home: Only there, the effect would be compounded as it would touch on our essential domestic infrastructure.

**Let me be blunt: DRM for domestic infrastructure - Residential Rights Management if you will - should under no circumstance become part of our homes.**

**Rights managements is hard to understand.** If you've ever encountered a situation where you needed to assign read/write/execute rights for a personal computer, server or network without proper training, you'll know how confusing this is - even professionals regularly fail at considering the exact rights settings, and more importantly at considering all possible scenarious in which any setting might be required or appropriate. 

In a connected home we'd have to work with complex interacting layers of access rights for buildings, apartments, rooms, devices, users - all of which are entirely non-intuitive to handle. 

**With connectivity come power struggles and access & rights management.**

**Who has root to your home?** Root access [^3] is what we call full, unfettered access - including the rights to shut out other users or delete all data. Who are the parties who have this kind of access to your home? Even at the best of times, scenarios of having another entity, person, or organization have control over your home seem problematic. Screw-ups seem both unavoidable and potentially horrendous.

For a little taster of power struggles to come, consider the following scenerios and questions of remotely controlled rights or restrictions management:

- **A renter is late on their lease.** Can the landlord shut down services or access until the rent is paid? Potentially non-essential services like air conditioning? Essential services like fridge or oven?  Access to the apartment? Under which conditions? 
- **A teenager comes home later than agreed with their parents and finds the door does not unlock.** The parents, feeling wronged and slightly vindictive, set up the home's smart lock not to let their kid in after 10pm.
- **An elderly person in an assistive living facility wants to cook a meal.** Yet, the oven stays cold this morning: An algorithm (or son, or insurance) has decided to reduce the risk of fire and burns, so the resident's usage rights to the oven were remotely revoked.
- **A malicious landlord wants to get rid off a renter and starts messing with lights and heating.** What kind of recourse do renters have if they lose control of the infrastructure they live in?
- **A resident is a diabetic.** Can their health insurance track if a diabetic takes any sweet beverage or food out of the fridge, and reports back? Could they block access to the fridge? How about changing the orders for grocery delivery services?
- **A young couple is two weeks late on their mortgage payments.** Can the bank shut them out of their homes by taking them off list of authorized users in the smart lock's facial recognition system?[^4]

We chose those pointedly dystopian scenarios for a reason: Many of them start off with a legitimate reason, concern, or gripe - and then they go overboard, leveraging connected home systems in ways that go entirely overboard (or so we think).

We believe that residents should be in control of their domestic lives, limited only by a legal framework that allows for recourse: As a rule of thumb, no company or other entity should unilaterally be in a position to shut down services in the home or change the rules of engagement like in the world of web services: *The iTunes Terms of Services just changed.* 

We need to ask ourselves: **Who controls - or should be able to control - access to and within a home?** Is it going to be the resident, landlord, owner, renter? An insurance, bank, or Airbnb? What are the kind of legal frameworks that can ensure that residents are in charge of their home?

**The home is a space that needs special protections.**
